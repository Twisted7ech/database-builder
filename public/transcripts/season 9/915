(joey nods)\n\nchandler: (entering, carrying a large box) honey, i'm old!\n\nmonica: (standing up, walking towards him) what's wrong?\n\nchandler: i am so much older than these other interns. i can't compete with them.\n\nmonica: so you're a little older. try to look at the positive: you have all this life experience.\n\nchandler: yes, but i don't think life experience with these. (he opens the box and takes an inline skate-like sneaker out)\n\njoey: wooooooooow (he takes the sneaker) it's like they're on fire!\n\nmonica: what are they? (they sit down again)\n\nchandler: they're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.\n\njoey: (determined) i give you $ 500 for them!\n\nchandler: what am i supposed to do with these?\n\nmonica: ah, come on, sneakers are easy. you wear sneakers all the time.\n\nchandler: well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore. apparently, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and i think i heard somebody say "slorps". (he takes a sneaker) and here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity!
