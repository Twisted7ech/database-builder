(takes the bowl from monica)\n\nchandler: oh, yeah! thanks for inventing the lottery!\n\nrachel: ok, that's it! just give'em to me! i'll split them up! (she tries to snatch the bowl from joey's hands but she can't, so she pinches his nipple and she manages to take it)\n\njoey: (in pain) oh!\n\nphoebe: (she takes the bowl from rachel's hands and she starts running around the room and yelling) ooooohhhhh!\n\nross: (trying to stop her) hey, hey!!\n\nphoebe: (keeping on running and yelling) ooooohhhhh!
