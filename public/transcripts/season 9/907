(points at monica) people eat birds... bird\n\n\n\nmeat... now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you go to a\n\nrestaurant and you say: "excuse me, i'll have a bucket of fried bird."\n\n(laughs again) or... or maybe just a wing or... (realises...)\n\nmonica: joey, i think you should consider something a little less risky. i\n\nmean, i think in this market, real estate is your best investment.the fed.\n\njust lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally\n\ndeductible. (looks at chandler) that's right, i know some stuff!\n\njoey: real estate, huh? hmmm...\n\nmonica: (very excited) oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment?\n\nrichard!\n\nchandler: (imitating monica) oh, and you know whose knowledge of her\n\nex-boyfriend is shocking? monica!\n\nmonica: my dad told me. they play golf together.\n\nchandler: oh, well... maybe i'll join them some time. i just hope the club\n\ndoesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.\n\n\n\n[scene, monica and chandler's apartment. rachel and monica are sitting at\n\nthe dinner table and phoebe enters, knocking on the door.]\n\nphoebe: hi!\n\nrachel and monica: hey!\n\nphoebe: listen! you have to help me pick a dress 'cause i'm meeting mike's\n\nparents tonight!

(ross tries to impersonate emma's laugh, but it\n\ncomes out very squeaky, very high pitched. he laughs about himself but then\n\nlooks at rachel, realises that it sounded weird and straightens his face.)\n\nonly... only not creepy.\n\nrachel: well... well, what did you do to make her laugh? (excited)\n\nross: i uhm... well, i sang... (rachel gasps) well actually i rapped... baby\n\ngot back... (rachel's face changes from excited to angry)\n\nrachel: you what? you sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who\n\nlikes to have sex with women with giant asses?\n\nross: but you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a\n\nhealthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy\n\ndoubles.\n\nrachel: (disgusted) owwwww...\n\nross: please don't take her away from me!\n\n[scene, richard's apartment. there's a knock on the door.the listing agent\n\nopens the door for chandler and joey.]\n\ncatherine: oh hi, come on in. i'm catherine, the listing agent.\n\njoey: hi i'm joey. this is chandler.\n\nchandler: so how come richard's selling the place? went bankrupt? medical\n\nmalpractice? choked on his own moustache?\n\ncatherine: actually, he is buying a much bigger place. it's got a great view\n\nof central pa.....\n\nchandler: mmm that's enough about you!\n\njoey: is there anything we should know about the apartment?\n\ncatherine: all the appliances are included. there is a lot of light, a new\n\nkitchen... i think you guys would be very happy here... (joey and chandler\n\nboth realise what she's assuming and start laughing.)\n\nchandler: no, no, no, no, no, no! no, no... we're not together. we're not a\n\ncouple. we're definately not a couple.\n\ncatherine: oh... okay, sorry!\n\njoey: well, you seem pretty insulted by that. what? i'm not good enough for\n\nyou?\n\nchandler: we're not gonna have this conversation again... look at this\n\nplace. why am i so intimidated by this guy? pretentious art, this huge macho\n\ncouch. when we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing\n\nmonica to a real man! (laughs) you don't think he's here, do you? (joey\n\nlooks around)\n\njoey: you know what it is? it's a nice place but i gotta see i don't know if\n\ni see myself living here. oh, oh, oh, let me see... (joey sits down on the\n\ncouch, mimes opening a can and puts his hand down his pants) yeah, i could\n\nsee it.\n\nchandler: (chandler looks around the place and his eye gets caught by\n\nrichard's video collection) look at these videos. you know, i mean, who does\n\nhe think he is? magnum force, dirty harry, cool hand luke... oh my god!\n\njoey: what?\n\nchandler: there's a tape here with monica's name on it.\n\njoey: ooh! a tape with a girls name on it. it's probably a sex tape...\n\n(realises) wait a minute... this says monica... (looks around) and this is\n\nrichard's apartment... (realises some more)\n\nchandler: get there faster! (joey gasps and finally understands...)\n\n[scene, mike's parents building. phoebe gets out of the classy elevator,\n\nlooking all dressed up like an older woman, and very un-phoebe. she walks to\n\nthe door and rings the doorbell.]\n\nmike: wow! you look like... like my mom.\n\nphoebe: i'm wearing pantyhose!\n\nmike: great! come on in! (mike kisses her on the cheek. a butler walks in\n\nand takes phoebe's coat.)\n\nphoebe: oh, thank you! oh... oh my god, you're rich!\n\nmike: no, my parents are rich.\n\nphoebe: yeah, so... they gotta die someday. (mike's parents walk in) hello!\n\nmike: mom, dad, this is phoebe. phoebe, these are my parents: theodore and\n\nbitsy.\n\nphoebe: (in a very posh accent) theodore... bitsy... what a delight!\n\nbitsy: it's so nice to finally meet you!\n\nphoebe: and you... your home is lovely.\n\nbitsy: well thank you, i'll give you a tour later. it's actually three\n\nfloors.\n\nphoebe: holy crap!\n\nbitsy: phoebe, why don't you come in the living room and meet our friends?\n\nphoebe: oh, try and stop me!\n\nmike: hey... wh... what are you doing?\n\nphoebe: (no accent) i'm trying to get your parents to like me.\n\nmike: yeah, i'm sure they will, but you don't have to do this... i'm wanting\n\nthem to get to know phoebe, not (accent) phoebe...\n\nphoebe: (accent) got it! it... it's hard to stop...\n\nmike: well, come on...\n\ntheodore: phoebe, these are our friends, tom and sue angle.\n\nbitsy: phoebe, come sit. tell us a little bit about yourself... so where are\n\nyou from?\n\nphoebe: (no accent) uhm... okay, well, allright, uhm... originally i'm from\n\nupstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went to\n\nprison, so... i just moved to the city where uhm... i actually lived in a\n\nburned out buick lesabre for a while... (frowns are received) which was\n\nokay, that was okay, until uhm... i got hepatitis, you know, 'cause this\n\npimp spit in my mouth and... but i... i got over it and uhm... anyway, now\n\ni'm uhm... a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't\n\nalways steady money but at least i don't pay taxes, huh... (everyone in the\n\nroom finds it a bit surreal, which phoebe realises and starts to talk in the\n\naccent again) so... where does everyone summer?\n\ncommercial break\n\n[scene, mike's parents house again.]\n\nphoebe: god! god! this is not going well.\n\nmike: no, no, no, you're doing fine, really... why don't you go talk to my\n\ndad?\n\nphoebe: okay, okay, okay, okay... still sure about me being myself?\n\nmike: absolutely! or maybe just a little less pimp spit.\n\nphoebe: so theodore... i uhm... i can see where mike gets his good looks\n\nfrom...\n\ntheodore: oh... well...\n\nphoebe: yeah... and that physique! you must work out all the time...\n\ntheodore: oh no, not all the time... i do the best i can...\n\nphoebe: yeah i bet! look out!

(bitsy walks away)\n\nmike: awesome!\n\n[scene, monica and chandler's apartment. only chandler is there with the\n\nvideotape in his hands, standing in front of the tv set.]\n\nchandler: i'm not gonna watch it... i don't need to watch it... i mean, what\n\ngood could possibly come from watching? (sighs) well, we know i'm gonna\n\nwatch it. (chandler moves to put the tape in the vcr and joey enters the\n\napartment)\n\njoey: hey dude, what's up?\n\nchandler: don't judge me, i'm only human!\n\njoey: did you take that tape?\n\nchandler: i had to! okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape\n\nof your wife in another guys' apartment... wouldn't you need to know what\n\nwas on it?\n\njoey: i don't know. who'm i'm married to?\n\nchandler: some girl...!?\n\njoey: she hot?\n\nchandler: yeah...!?\n\njoey: how did she get me to settle down?\n\nchandler: allright, i'm gonna watch it... i mean look, it's probably not\n\neven what i think it is... and even if it is... it can't possibly be as bad\n\nas what i'm picturing in my head... (laughs nervously) can it?\n\njoey: guess i don't know. my experience: if a girl says yes to being\n\ntaped... she doesn't say no to much else, i tell ya...\n\nchandler: then you're gonna have to watch it for me.\n\njoey: (backs off) what? whoo... what?\n\nchandler: just for a few seconds, so i can know what it is... please?\n\njoey: all right, fine... but if i enjoy this, you have only yourself to\n\nblame... (chandler turns his back to the tv. joey puts the tape in the vcr,\n\nswitches it on and watches what's on the tape... it's clearly a american\n\nfootball match, with the referee's whistle blowing, the crowds cheering...)\n\nchandler: why am i hearing cheering?\n\njoey: well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.\n\nchandler: football? just football?\n\njoey: yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.\n\nchandler: it's football... it's just football... this is great! this is the\n\nfirst time i've ever enjoyed football... it may be customary to get a\n\nbeer... (chandler walks to the fridge, his back turned to the tv and a\n\nmoaning sound replaces the cheering of the crowd... joey's eyes double in\n\nsize...) what the... (chandler turns around, but joey already took a sprint\n\nfor chandler, jumps, and floors chandler in the open space in front of the\n\napartment door...) what are you doing?\n\njoey: you don't wanna see what i just saw! (at this moment monica comes\n\nhome, and sees chandler flat on his back on the floor and joey pinning him\n\ndown)\n\nmonica: what are you guys doing? (monica hears the moaning coming from the\n\ntv and looks at it) oh my god, is that richard? (it only takes a split\n\nsecond for joey to realise, he pulls monica down by her jacket, and she\n\nfalls, face down next to chandler. chandler gets up a bit, and joey quickly\n\ncovers chandler's eyes with his hand.)\n\n[scene, ross and rachel's apartment. emma is sitting in her chair on the\n\napothecary table and rachel is trying to make her laugh.]\n\nrachel: okay... aahhh... please laugh for mommy... please? please laugh for\n\nmommy... (rachel makes a funny face, sticking her tongue out, making a\n\nfarting noise and using her hands as antlers, wiggling her fingers... no\n\nresponse from emma...) not funny huh? oh so, is it... only offensive novelty\n\nrap? or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'cause mommy can rap...\n\n(rachel tries to rap and makes weird movements with her arms in the\n\nprocess.) my name is mommy and i'm here to say / that all the babies are...\n\noh, i can't rap... allright sweetheart... this is only because i love you so\n\nmuch, and i know that you're not gonna tell anybody... (rachel's face is\n\ntelling "oh what am i doing? the things i have to go through... and she\n\nstarts to rap) i like... big butts and i cannot lie... / you other brothers\n\ncan't deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round\n\nthing in your face... (emma starts to laugh) yes! yes! yes! yes! oohhhhh!\n\noh! (rachel now really gets into it, and her insecure movements start\n\ngetting better) i like big butts and i cannot lie... / you other brothers\n\ncan't deny... oh emma you're laughing! oh you are, you really do like big\n\nbutts, don't you. oh you beautiful little weirdo... (rachel picks up emma\n\nand ross now enters)\n\nross: hey!\n\nrachel: oh you missed it. she was laughing. oh it was amazing. it was\n\namazing. it was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...\n\nross: oh i know, isn't it? ooh... what'd you do to get her to laugh?\n\nrachel: oh! you know, i just... couple of things i tried ... i just sang a\n\nlittle doo... itsy bitsy spider...\n\nross: you sang baby got back didn't you?\n\nrachel: nothing else worked. that girl is all about the ass...\n\n[scene, mike's parents house, the dining room. mike, phoebe, mike's parents\n\nand the angles are there.]\n\nphoebe: ...and then it goes back to the chorus... smelly cat, sme-lly ca-t /\n\ni-t's not your fau-lt. and that's the end of the song... i realise that you\n\ndidn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes.\n\nmike: phoebe writes lots of great songs. wha... what was that one you sang\n\nthe other night that everybody just loved?\n\nphoebe: oh, pervert parade?\n\nmike: (sighs) no...\n\nphoebe: oh, ode to a pubic hair?\n\nmike: stop! (the butler serves dinner)\n\nphoebe: oh god! is that veal?\n\nmike: mom, i thought i told you... phoebe's a vegetarian.\n\nbitsy: oh!\n\nphoebe: oh no, no, no, no... that's okay, that's okay... i mean, i'm... i am\n\na vegetarian... except for veal... yeah no, veal i love...\n\nmike: phoebe you don't have to eat...\n\nphoebe: no, no, no, i actually it's any baby animals: kittens, fish\n\nbabies... you know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat\n\nrunning through it... (she cuts the meat, picks it up with her fork and\n\nholds it in front of her mouth, which she keeps closed, trying to overcome\n\nher vegetarian thoughts... and... puts it in her mouth... clearly not\n\nenjoying the meat...) hmmm... yummy (everybody seems okay with it, except\n\nmike. he's making a hmmmm.... face... then phoebe swallows it) hmmm... (at\n\nfirst she likes it, but then, in an instant puts her hand in front of her\n\nmouth and runs from the table. you hear a door slamming.)\n\nmike: so...? what do you think? (looks at his parents, which look in\n\ndisgust)\n\n[scene, monica and chandler's. monica switches off the vcr. joey and\n\nchandler are behind the couch.]\n\nmonica: so you stole that tape from richard's apartment?\n\nchandler: whoho ho... listen to the judgement from the porn star!\n\nmonica: that tape was never meant to be seen by... (pauses) joey i would\n\nfeel more comfortable if i was having this conversation in private.\n\njoey: (laughs) monica, look... i don't think you and i have any secrets\n\nanymore... (monica keeps looking at joey) not ready to joke about it yet,\n\nokay, i see you later. (joey walks out)\n\nmonica: why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you\n\nwatch it?\n\nchandler: because that's who i am, okay? i'm sure a mature man like richard\n\ncould see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. just'd be another\n\nsaucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and\n\nmoustaches.\n\nmonica: is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?\n\nchandler: this is about you and richard. he's clearly not over you. he keeps\n\na tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.\n\nmonica: isn't that sad? i mean, can you see how pathetic that is? you\n\nshouldn't be jealous. you should feel bad for him.\n\nchandler: oh, yeah, well, poor richard. y'... i can grow a moustache!\n\nmonica: chandler, this is not our problem. we've got each other. that's all\n\nthat matters.\n\nchandler: yeah, oh, but i just keep picturing you rolling around with him\n\nwith your cowboy boots in the air...\n\nmonica: cowboy boots? i've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life! (she\n\nturns on the video again)\n\nchandler: oh, good, good. play more, 'cause i wanna see how it ends.\n\nmonica: that's not me!\n\nchandler: what...? that's not you! life is good again! ride 'em cowgirl!\n\nmonica: that bastard taped over me! (chandler's expression changes)\n\nchandler: is that a problem?\n\nmonica: i-it's just so insulting! big spring for a new blank tape, doctor!\n\n[scene, mike's parents house. dining room again. both mike and phoebe are\n\nnot at the table, but the others still are.]\n\ntheodore: i can't imagine what he sees in her.\n\nbitsy: she actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife of his. (mike\n\nwalks in) oh, hello dear...\n\nmike: hey, what's going on?\n\nbitsy: we were just chit-chatting. how's your friend?\n\nmike: a little better.\n\nbitsy: by the way, do you know who's moving back into town? tom and sue's\n\ndaughter jen.\n\ntheodore: you remember her michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and...\n\nsingle.\n\nmike: i'm not interested.\n\nbitsy: oh, please darling, let's be honest. you can have all the... sailor\n\nfun you want with that one, but... let's be real...\n\nmike: all right, stop! you know, all phoebe has done tonight is trying to\n\nget you to like her. and maybe that hasn't been clear all the time, but she\n\ndid her best. and yeah... she's a little different than you are...\n\nbitsy: michael, a pimp spit in her mouth! (phoebe almost enters the room,\n\nbut she hears the discussion and waits and evesdrops next to the\n\ndoor-opening.)\n\nmike: so what? i mean if even i can get past that, it shouldn't bother you.\n\nand you don't have to like her. you just have to accept the fact that i do.\n\ni mean, if you even can't be civil to the woman i love...\n\nbitsy: the woman you what? (phoebe overheard what michael said and now\n\nenters the room)\n\nphoebe: yeah... the woman you what?\n\nmike: the woman i love... (he walks to phoebe) i love you... which is\n\nprobably something i shouldn't say for the first time in front of my\n\nparents... and tom and sue...who are by the way the most sinfully boring\n\ni've ever met in my life...\n\nphoebe: i love you too...\n\nmike: you do?\n\nphoebe: yeah...! how great is this...? (they kiss)\n\nmike: wanna get out of here?\n\nphoebe: okay.\n\nmike: mom, dad, thanks for dinner.\n\nphoebe: i had a great time.
