(holds up six fingers.) (realizes his mistake) argh!!!\nphoebe: joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?\njoey: because i forgot about our date, i'm so sorry.\nmike: i'm sorry too. and just to be clear, i didn't hit his mother with a car.\nphoebe: (to joey) you are unbelievable! i spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. mary ellen is really smart and cute and loose.\nmary ellen: hey!\nphoebe: who are you kidding? (to joey) you just find some guy off the street for me? oh god! this is humiliating!\njoey: look phoebe i'm so sorry! hey, look, if you don't like this guy i can find you a better one.

(pause) so before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but i guess now it's old job, (raises his hand) me, (raises his hand) new job.\nmonica: i'm gonna miss this hand! okay i know it's a lot to ask, but oh my god chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\nchandler: what happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?\nmonica: well, if you really think about it, i mean four days is not that long. i mean, i see you monday before you go to work, and i see you thursday when you get back, and i always work late on tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. and well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.\nchandler: i think you should take the job.\nmonica: really?\nchandler: yeah. i know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.\nmonica: that's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!\n(ross and rachel enter with emma.)\nross: hey!\nmonica: how was the pediatrician?\nrachel: oh, i really liked him. (looks at ross) yeah, it was really, really, really good.\nross: you promised you wouldn't say anything.\nrachel: i know. (pause) ross still sees his pediatrician!!! (to ross) i don't care!\nmonica: are you serious? you still see dr. gettleman?\nross: he's a brilliant diagnostician!\nchandler: diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?\nrachel: ross, seriously! you've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.\nross: why? why? i know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? he knows my medical history, and every time i go in there, he makes a big deal. 'ah look, it's my favorite patient!'\nchandler: does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?\nross: hey, i seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!\nchandler: that was not a security blanket! that was a wall-hanging!\nross: it didn't spend much time on the wall!!!\n\n[scene, central perk]\n\nmike: excuse me, hi. i was hoping i would run into you. can we talk?\nphoebe: sure.\nmike: i'm sorry, really, i'm so embarrassed. really, i'm a pretty nice guy. just ask my parole officer...apparently i'm not a funny guy.\nphoebe: why did you go along with that?\nmike: because i was told i'd get a free dinner, which i didn't. and that i'd meet a pretty girl. which i did.\nphoebe: that's true. (pause) well, is anything you told me about yourself true?\nmike: my name in mike, and i do play piano.\nphoebe: prove it.\nmike: there isn't a piano here.\nphoebe: that wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.\nmike: (plays 'air piano')\nphoebe: you are really good! i play a little guitar myself.\nmike: really?\nphoebe: uhuh.\nmike: that's great. what kind of music do you play?\nphoebe: well, like acoustic folksy stuff. you know? but right now i'm working on a couple 'iron maiden' covers.\nmike: do you think that maybe, sometime, i could...\nphoebe: it's okay. go ahead, ask me out.\nmike: okay. do you think maybe sometime i could take you out?\njoey: (walks in)\nphoebe: (to mike) oh, you just caught me off guard! yeah, that would be nice.\njoey: look at this. my two best friends!\n(phoebe and mike look at him, and he goes over to the counter.)\n\n[scene, pediatrician's office]\n\nross: excuse me, i don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me.\nreceptionist: the doctor will be right with you sir.\ngirl: (reading a book) mommy, i can't find waldo.\nross: with the circus? he's behind the elephant.\nwoman: wow, so your child is a big fan of the waldo books too?\nross: yeah, that's how i know. i'm ross by the way.\nsally: hi, i'm sally. so, no ring. can i assume you are also a single parent?\nross: i am a single parent.\nsally: it's hard isn't it? there's almost no time for a social life. i mean, where are you gonna meet someone?\nross: well, let's say, i don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office.\nnurse: (to ross) rossy, we're ready for you.\nross: hmm, yeah.
