"cheese. it's milk that you chew." "crackers. because your cheese needs a buddy." "a grape. because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"\n\nmonica: i got one. "socks. because your family's feet deserve the best."\n\nchandler: honey? leave it to the pros.\n\nmonica: i actually know someone in advertising. i grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. maybe i can get him to meet you? give me the phone.\n\nchandler: "the phone. bringing you closer to people...who have phones."\n\nmonica: "marriage. it's not for everybody."\n\n[scene, ralph lauren]\n\nrachel: that went well. almost everybody knew that she was a girl.\n\nross: yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.\n\n\n\nrachel: i'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . (to the guy behind her desk) who the hell are you!?\n\nguy: who the hell are you?\n\nrachel: i'm the hell person whose office this is!\n\nross: good one, rach.\n\nguy: i'm gavin mitchell, the person who's taken over your job.\n\nrachel: excuse me?\n\ngavin: oh, your baby's so cute. why did you put a pink bow on a boy?\n\n[scene, dool set]\n\nphoebe: joey, look at me! i'm a nurse!\n\njoey: yes you are. i think it may be time for my sponge bath. sorry, i'm just so used to hitting on the extras. so, are you excited about your scene?\n\nphoebe: yeah! but i'm a little shaky and nervous.\n\njoey: oh, relax. don't be. you'll be fine, you'll be fine. they'll probably just make you stand in the back.\n\ndirector: okay, okay, okay!

(off the director's look) alright, eight.\n\ndirector: and...action!\n\n(ok, here we go again. phoebe starts walking toward the operating table, but stops every time the tray starts to rattle. she eventually drops it on the floor, but finishes the scene anyway by putting the now non-existent tray on the table.)\n\n[scene, central perk]\n\ninterviewer: so, do you have any other question about advertising?\n\nchandler: no, no. but let me show you what i can do. "bagels and donuts. round food for every mood."\n\n\n\ninterviewer: monica warned me you might do that. i actually think we might have something for you at the agency.\n\nchandler: really? that's great!\n\ninterviewer: it's an unpaid internship.\n\nchandler: it's funny. when you said "unpaid" it sounded like you said "unpaid."\n\ninterviewer: come on now. monica has a good job. and it's not like you have a family to support.\n\nchandler: actually, we're trying, and i don't think monica's gonna wanna postpone it. we're supposed to have sex tonight. actually, she's probably at home naked right now. i tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. i can just picture her on the bed right now.\n\ninterviewer: stop!\n\ninterviewer: okay.\n\n[scene, ralph lauren]\n\nrachel: wait a minute! what do you mean, you're taking over my job?\n\ngavin: well, while you were on your baby vacation i was doing your job.\n\nrachel: a vacation? my idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.\n\ngavin: clearly you've never been to sandles paradise island.\n\nrachel: alright! don't get too comfortable there, because i'm back in two weeks! and i want everything back to the way it was. i can't say that i care too much for the way you've rearranged my office.\n\ngavin: i can't say i care too much for that smell you've brought in with you.\n\nrachel: excuse me?\n\nross: rach we have a code brown situation.\n\nrachel: can you please, please take care of it for me?\n\nross: alright, but you have to do one sometime.\n\nrachel: let me just get this straight! so i go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?\n\ngavin: well, there was talk of shutting down ralph lauren all together.\n\nrachel: that's right. you're very cheeky for a temp.\n\ngavin: i'm not a temp. i was transferred here from another department.\n\nrachel: oh yeah, what department was that? the jerk department?\n\ngavin: oh, they didn't tell me about your quick wit.\n\nrachel: did they mention that i'm rubber and you're glue?\n\nmr. zelner: (enters) gavin, ralph loved your ideas.\n\nrachel: oh, hi mr. zelner.\n\nmr. zelner: rachel, i see you've met gavin. i must say, when you left us we weren't sure what we were gonna do. but then, gavin to the rescue. super gavin!\n\nrachel: that's great. so now, super gavin, when i come back where are you planning on flying off to?\n\ngavin: well, that's up to mr. zelner. i'm sure he will make the right decision.\n\nrachel: (to herself) oh, wow. super ass-kissing power.\n\nmr. zelner: incidentally, when are you coming back?\n\nrachel: today.\n\ngavin: you said two weeks.\n\nrachel: no, i said today! see, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.\n\n[scene, dool set]\n\njoey: hey.\n\nphoebe: hey. so, what did he say?\n\njoey: well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so i'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word "puppy." okay, so he said: "if your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, i'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass."\n\nphoebe: i'm sorry, i can't do this. i'm not an actor.\n\njoey: that's right, you're not. you're a nurse. you're nurse with tray.\n\nphoebe: joey.\n\njoey: no, no. nurse with tray doesn't know joey, she doesn't have time for friends. she gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!\n\nphoebe: who dies?\n\njoey: (points to man on operating table) man with eye patch! you get in there and you do your job.\n\nphoebe: yes, doctor.\n\njoey: okay.\n\ndirector: okay, let's try this one more time.\n\nphoebe: hang in there, man with eye patch, your tray is coming!\n\ndirector: and...action!\n\nphoebe: (does the scene) yes, i did it!!! i nailed it!!! yay! what's next?\n\ndirector: the rest of the scene.\n\nphoebe: okay, from the top, people!\n\n[scene, ralph lauren]\n\nrachel: listen. sudden change of plans. my maternity leave just ended. they told me that if i didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me.\n\nross: what? no, that's illegal. i'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...\n\nrachel: alright, alright. calm down norma rae. they didn't actually say that. i'm just afraid if i don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.\n\nross: what about emma? we don't have a nanny.\n\nrachel: i know. you know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. can you please just take care of her for today?\n\nross: absolutely. just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.\n\nrachel: come on, i don't know what else to do.\n\nross: fine, fine. (to emma) we'll have fun, won't we? yes, we will, yes we will. (gives her a kiss, and the pink bow tapes itself to his head.)\n\nrachel: ross?\n\nross: huh?\n\nrachel: you're pretty.\n\n[scene, chandler and monica's]\n\nchandler: whatever i decide to do, i'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. it's gonna be a while before i make a living at it. maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.\n\nross: so you have to tell monica you don't want to have a baby right now?\n\nchandler: yeah.\n\nross: (hugs chandler) good-bye.\n\nmonica: (enters) okay, it's baby time. pants off bing.

(mr. zelner enters) oh, hello, mr. zelner. we're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.\n\nmr. zelner: good, because it's in ten minutes.\n\nrachel: what? i can't do that! i have the baby, and ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.\n\nmr. zelner: well, then gavin can give the presentation, okay, we have to do it now. ralph needs to leave early today. he's going helicopter shopping.\n\nrachel: well, there you go. you win, you win. you get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that i worked here, and then ralph will buy his helicopter, and super gavin will just fly right along side of him!\n\ngavin: you can do the presentation.\n\nrachel: no, i can't, i have a baby.\n\ngavin: i'll watch her.\n\nrachel: why would you do that?\n\ngavin: because you've worked really hard, and it's your job, and you're a little crazy.\n\nrachel: that's really nice.\n\ngavin: i should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.\n\nrachel: then you're not gonna like what's coming. (starts crying) i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry. thank you, thank you.\n\ngavin: i'm really fine, don't worry, i'm great with children. (to emma) gavin mitchell. pleased to meet you.\n\n[scene, dool set]\n\njoey: please don't fire my friend. just let me talk to her.\n\ndirector: okay, okay. but this is her last chance.\n\njoey: thank you, thank you. how about i do something for you? tomorrow, i'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?\n\njoey: hey, listen pheebs. i was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit drake, you just wait on the tables?\n\nphoebe: i can't do that. i'm an actor. i have a process.\n\njoey: you're a masseuse. you have a table with a hole in it.\n\nphoebe: wait a minute, i see what's happening here. you're threatened.\n\njoey: what?\n\nphoebe: yeah, i'm so good in this scene that i'm stealing focus from you. well, rise to the challenge tribianni 'cause i just raised the bar. come join me up here!\n\njoey: (to the director) yeah, you can fire her, but i would call security, she won't go easy.\n\n[scene, chandler and monica's]\n\nmonica: you faked it? you couldn't have faked it!\n\nchandler: oh yes you can. you just make the faces and the noises.\n\nmonica: guys can fake it? unbelievable. the one thing that's ours! besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?\n\nchandler: that's actually why. look, i'm starting a whole new career now, and i'm not saying that i don't want to have a baby, i'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.\n\nmonica: like a month?\n\nchandler: or a year?\n\nmonica: really, you want to wait a year?\n\nchandler: it could be less than a year. i mean, you've heard my stuff. "pants. like shorts, but longer." (pause) it'll probably be more than a year.\n\nmonica: i really wanna have a baby.\n\nchandler: yeah, me too. look, i'll just get my old job back.\n\nmonica: no, i want you to have a job that you love. not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.\n\nchandler: i quit and you learn what i do?\n\nmonica: it's just, i think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. i mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. there's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but i think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.\n\nchandler: i guess. it's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.\n\nmonica: it's gonna be really scary. i mean, god. when we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. i mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, i won't have time to clean it. what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? messes up all the ribbons?! what if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? where will all the ribbons go!?!\n\nchandler: should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?\n\nmonica: yes, please!\n\nchandler: oh, and i promise, i will not fake it this time.\n\nmonica: i wish i could say the same. i'm a little shook up!\n\n[closing credits]\n\n[scene, dool set]\n\njoey/drake: i know you botched that operation on purpose. i can't prove it yet, but when i do, you'll be going to jail for murder. i don't care if you are my brother.\n\nman: i'm not your brother.\n\nphoebe/waitress: what about my children drake?! huh!? (she starts running around on the set with a security guy chasing her) no!! no!! no! god!\n\n
