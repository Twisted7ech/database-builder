(he leaves his seat to mike, and stands there looking for a chair. he finally goes to monica and chandler's table)\n\nmike: phoebe, i love you. i mean, i missed you so much these last few months and i thought we were apart for a good reason, but then i suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.\n\ndavid: kinda stepped on the toes of what i was going to say.\n\nmike: sorry david, but she really has to know this.\n\ndavid: alright, but after this i want to see you outside. if the rain stops.\n\nmonica: you're the most incredible woman i've ever met. how can i lose you? (phoebe looks very flattered) now, i don't actually have a ring...\n\ndavid: i have a ring.\n\nchandler: i wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.\n\ndavid: phoebe, will you marry me?\n\nphoebe: (smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering) no!\n\ndavid: um... ha ha!\n\nphoebe: i love you. but i never needed a proposal from you. i just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.\n\nmike: we can have any future you want.\n\n(they hold their hands, gazing at each other)\n\ndavid: ok, i'm gonna take off.\n\nphoebe: david, i'm so sorry, i'm sorry.\n\ndavid: just so i know, if i had asked first...\n\nphoebe: yeah, i might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.\n\ndavid: please, you don't have to explain. i mean, perhaps if i hadn't gone to minsk things would have worked out for us. and i wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. it was a good trip! (he leaves)\n\nmike: is it ok if i hug you now?\n\nphoebe: yes! (they hug)\n\nmonica: (to everybody) because of our meddling! alright?\n\n[scene, monica and chandler's room. monica and chandler are in bed.]\n\nchandler: oh, ain't this nice? it's so quiet, i could just lie here all day.\n\nmonica: i know (she snuggles to him)\n\n(rachel runs in)\n\nrachel: (walking in hurriedly) open your drapes! open your drapes!\n\nchandler: i'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!\n\n(rachel opens the drapes)\n\nmonica: the sun is out!\n\nchandler: hey! remember when i had corneas?\n\nmonica: ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and i'll get the magazines and the lotion.\n\nchandler: ladies? ross's speech is in 45 minutes.\n\nrachel: nooo!\n\nmonica: damn it!\n\nross: (from across the wall) walls are pretty thin, guys!\n\n[scene, conference room. ross is making his keynote speech]\n\nross: then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.\n\nrachel: look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, i'm so jealous!\n\nross: finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: gigantosaurus, argentinasaurus...\n\nchandler: (to a paleontologist sitting next to him) not to mention the cold sores.\n\n(the paleontologist glares at chandler)\n\nross: and that's just the herbivores. i'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.\n\n(all the paleontologists laugh)\n\nchandler: (to the one sitting next to him) really?\n\nross: but all kidding aside, in much the same way that homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus...\n\n(joey laughs)\n\ncharlie: what?\n\njoey: he said "erectus"!\n\ncharlie: you're... you're kidding, right?\n\njoey: no, he really said it.\n\nross: ... and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus...\n\n(rachel laughs)\n\njoey: erectus?\n\nrachel: homo.\n\n[scene, the hotel conference room]\n\nross: (concluding his speech)... in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century.

(pauses) i'm your groupie!\n\nross: (joking) i'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!\n\n(ross giggles, but charlie isn't amused at all.)\n\nross: (realizing his joke wasn't so good, but still giggling) look, i took it too far!\n\n[scene, the hotel lobby. monica, phoebe, chandler and mike walk in from the outside.]\n\nmonica: (her hair bigger then before) i can't believe it's raining again! oh, it's so unfair!!!\n\n(they approach the buffet, where a couple of paleontologists are sipping their drinks)\n\nphoebe: well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. (grabs a drink and notices that the two men are upset) not you guys. you got it going on!\n\n(monica, phoebe, chandler and mike walk away, sipping their drinks)\n\nmonica: so, what are we gonna do today?\n\nmike: they have a game room downstairs! ping pong and stuff.\n\nmonica: (pleasantly surprised) ping pong? (to chandler) honey, they have ping pong! let's play!\n\nchandler: i don't think so!\n\nmonica: (disappointed) why not?\n\nchandler: because you know how competitive you get and well, i say it's cute, others disagree, and i'm lying!\n\nmonica: i'm not always that bad!\n\nchandler: oh, yeah? what happened when we played last time?\n\nmonica: (hesitatingly) i punched you...?\n\nchandler: and...?\n\nmonica: ... phoebe...?\n\nphoebe: ... and...?\n\nmonica: i clunked your heads together!\n\n(chandler turns to mike and gives him a "see what i mean?" look)\n\n[scene, joey and charlie's room]\n\n(joey is sitting in an armchair and wearing a diving mask. he pulls out a grape from a bunch of fake grapes on the coffee table, puts it on the snorkel's breathing tube and blows it out, then giggles to himself)\n\ncharlie: (walking in) hey! there you are!\n\njoey: hey! (stands up) as soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya!
