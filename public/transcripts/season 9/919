(a few people raise their hands)\n\nphoebe: ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) ha!\n\nmonica: alright, let me ask you this question: how many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again) .\n\nphoebe: ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?\n\nmonica: ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?

(in a romantic voice) and i remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when i would think to myself, my god, she... is... beautiful... (rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz i knew i could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.\n\n(joey and rachel continue to look at each other in silence for a while)\n\njoey: (excited) thanks dude!!! this is great!!!
