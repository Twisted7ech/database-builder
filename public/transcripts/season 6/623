(picks one up from the display in the corner.\n\nchandler: y’know, i’m so glad i picked you to help me with this.\n\nphoebe: huh? can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?\n\nchandler: yeah, i’m gonna stick with the ring. (goes to another display counter.) oh, this one’s nice! (pointing to another ring.) i like this one! sir? uh, kind sir? can i see this one?\n\nphoebe: (coming over after returning the musket) wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. okay? i know how to haggle. so let me handle this from here on out.\n\nmale jeweler: can i help you?\n\nchandler: uh-uh, yes. i would like to see that ring please.\n\nphoebe: or not, whatever.\n\nmale jeweler: this ring is from the 1920s, it’s a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.\n\nchandler: sir, can i ask you to umm, could you…hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?\n\nmale jeweler: okay.

(reaches for it then realizes) oh no! no-no, but i left my credit card with joey. (to phoebe) okay, i’ll go get it. you guard the ring.\n\nphoebe: why did you give your credit card to jey?\n\nchandler: oh, i gave it to him to buy some knicks tickets.  then the jerk didn't even invite me to the game! but i'm over it! whatever! (exits)\n\nphoebe: okay. (to the jeweler) listen, i’m sorry about before. do you have anything her for $10.\n\nmale jeweler: uh yes, i have these two rather beautiful $5 bills.

(pause) so full of dreams…\n\nrachel: i don’t care about the little dude! i can’t! i cannot listen to anymore of this! y’know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! and then it’s only because they get paid $100 an hour! do you know how much money i could’ve made listening to you? $2,000! and do you know when i figured that out? while you were talking!\n\npaul: what?! i can’t believe you’re trying to stifle me! when just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!\n\nrachel: oh… i’m sorry. i… i-i don’t mean—i didn’t mean to stifle you. i… this is all just a little overwhelming.\n\npaul: oh rachel, i’m so sorry. i didn’t mean to overwhelm you. it’s just that, when those gates open, you… (starts to breakdown.) hard to close ‘em. but they are closed now. believe me.\n\nrachel: i’m so glad, i’m so glad you shared.

(does so and laughs.) look, this is the most important thing i’m gonna do in my life. i wanna make sure it’s perfect.\n\nphoebe: okay. there may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ‘cause i heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. so maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.\n\nchandler: i can’t do that.\n\nphoebe: well you certainly can’t give her that stupid gumball ring.\n\nchandler: all right. where was he going?\n\nphoebe: yeah, it's a restaurant...(thinks about it)...it's....the rainbow something.\n\nchandler: rainbow room?\n\nphoebe: nope.\n\nchandler: rainbow grill?\n\nphoebe: nope.\n\nchandler: somewhere over the....?\n\nphoebe: (still thinking) l'espace.\n\nchandler: rainbow l'espace!\n\nphoebe: no, just l'espace.\n\nchandler: (is about to say something)...i'd love to know how you got from rainbow to l'espace.\n\nphoebe: (thinks about it) no you wouldn't.  you don't wanna get in here.

(walks over to him.) excuse me sir? could you come with me please? you have a phone call.\n\ncustomer: who is it?\n\nphoebe: it is your office.\n\ncustomer: do you know who at my office?\n\nphoebe: john?\n\ncustomer: oh john! great!\n\n(she brings him over to chandler.)\n\nphoebe: (to chandler) here he is.\n\nchandler: (to him) hi! hi. okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you’re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. so, i’m gonna need to have that back. (the guy isn’t sure.) but, in exchange i’m willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. (looking at the ring.) ew.\n\nphoebe: wow! i would trade.\n\ncustomer: it is beautiful, but i’m gonna use this one. now, if you’ll excuse me.\n\nchandler: no-no! this is my fiancée (phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring. you don’t want to break her heart now do you?\n\nphoebe: yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?\n\ncustomer: you’re dying?!\n\n(phoebe coughs.)\n\nchandler: yeah, she’s dying… of a cough apparently.\n\nphoebe: yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. see, if i’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity…\n\nchandler: (interrupting her) okay, that’s enough honey!\n\ncustomer: i don’t know. (pause) let me see the ring.\n\nchandler: great! okay, here. (holds the ring up for him.)\n\ncustomer: (looks at it) all right. (exchanges rings.)\n\nchandler: thank you. thank you. thank you! (to his girlfriend) and you are about to marry a wonderful man!
