(joey beats a hasty retreat.)\n\n[scene, the hallway between the apartments, ross is hiding behind that bump out on monica’s side waiting for phoebe and rachel. as they come up the stairs, he jumps out and yells…]\n\nross: danger!!! danger!!!!!\n\n(they both scream and jump away.)\n\nphoebe: ross!!!\n\nrachel: what the hell was that?!\n\nross: a lesson in the importance of unagi. (he starts doing the finger thing every time now.)\n\nphoebe: ohh, you’re a freak!!\n\nross: perhaps. now i’m curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?\n\nrachel: all right, so we weren’t prepared!\n\nross: i’m sorry i had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but i—look, i just want you guys to be safe.

(picks up a model of the saturn v rocket, that’s the one that took man to the moon.) uh, it’s an exact replica of apollo 8. i made it in the sixth grade.\n\nchandler: yeah, i guess i could use that. i could say that your love sends me to the moon.\n\nross: yeah-yeah, except apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. but you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely. (apollo 8 was the first one that orbited the moon and the one that read the christmas story from the orbit of the moon on christmas eve, 1968. they also took the famous earthrise picture of the earth rising over the moon.)\n\nchandler: wait a minute, i can’t give this to her.\n\nross: why not?\n\nchandler: because it says "captain ross" on the side and "i hate monica" on the bottom.\n\nross: oh.\n\n(chandler leaves dejectedly. when the door closes rachel and phoebe jump out from behind the curtains and scream…)\n\nphoebe and rachel: danger!!!!!\n\n(ross screams like a little girl.)\n\nrachel: ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.

(he throws it down and goes to her chest, grabs something, goes to the bed table, and takes out a pair of scissors. he turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties he just removed.) i can’t do it. i can’t do it. (he throws them both down and continues looking. he opens another closet door and finds a tape.) oh! oh! a mixed tape! a mixed tape!!
