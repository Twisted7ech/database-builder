(he grabs a plate and proceeds to load it with a huge pile of scrambled eggs. chandler just stares at him and joey reluctantly gives him a spoonful.)\n\nchandler: monica and i almost got married last night.\n\njoey: oh my god! that’s huge! (hugs him.) wait a minute, why come i wasn’t invited? and who was going to be your best man? don’t say, "ross." do not say, "ross."\n\nchandler: look, i just don’t think monica and i are ready to get married yet! y’know? i mean, i love her and everything but seeing ross and rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that monica and i are moving so fast. y’know? and, how do i tell her without crushing her?\n\njoey: oh! tell her she’s not marriage material.\n\nchandler: what?!\n\njoey: girls say it to me all the time! and believe me, if she’s anything like me, she’s just gonna be relieved.\n\n[pan to monica and phoebe having the same conversation.]\n\nmonica: how do i tell chandler that it’s too soon. it’s gonna break his heart, he’s not gonna think that i don’t love him anymore.\n\nphoebe: well you don’t.\n\nmonica: yes i do!\n\nphoebe: good! good! i was just testing you.\n\nchandler: (returning with joey) hi.\n\nmonica: oh hi! hi! y’know, we were just talking about bacon.\n\nphoebe: no, we were talking about tennis. tennis is more believable.\n\n(ross and rachel enter.)\n\nross: hey!\n\nthe girls: hey!\n\nchandler: hey!\n\n(they both sit down and rachel pours them both some coffee. they’re acting like nothing’s happened and everyone is just staring at them.)\n\nross: what?\n\nchandler: are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? or…\n\nrachel: (to ross) i don’t know. (to the gang.) what do you mean last night? nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.\n\nross: yeah!\n\nphoebe: uh-huh! ross invited us all to watch.\n\n(rachel turns to ross stunned.)\n\nmonica: rach! we weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!\n\nrachel: (gasps) who got married?! (ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)\n\nchandler: (not quite sure) you did.\n\nross: what?! hello! we didn’t get married.\n\nrachel: no, we didn’t get married! that’s ridiculous!\n\n(they turn to look at each other and suddenly remember that they did in fact get married.)\n\nross: we-we-we—i remember being in a chapel.\n\nrachel: oh my god.\n\nross: i—they would not let us get married when we were that drunk!\n\nrachel: no!\n\njoey: they let you get married when you’re drunk! most people who get married in vegas are drunk!\n\nphoebe: hell, i’m drunk right now!

(looks at ross.)\n\nchandler: well, i think, i think, ross already has one. now, this one’s free, right? because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free.\n\nross: laugh it up, but the joke’s on you. because we don’t need to get divorced, okay? we we’re just gonna get an annulment.\n\njoey: an annulment? ross! i don’t think surgery’s the answer here.\n\nphoebe: oh-oh, that’s your thing.\n\nross: what?\n\nphoebe: you’re thing. you’re thing. y’know? you’re the guy who gets divorced.\n\nall: oh yeah!\n\nross: no-no, that’s-that’s not my thing! i do not love getting divorced!\n\nphoebe: yes you do! this is your third divorce! you love divorce so much you’re probably gonna marry it! then it won’t work out and you’re gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. (pause) i’m so drunk.\n\n[scene, the casino floor, chandler and monica are walking through it.]\n\nmonica: so, what do you think we should do?\n\nchandler: i don’t know. but i-i-i know i love you!\n\nmonica: i know i love you! (they hug.)\n\nchandler: so where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? i love you.\n\nmonica: that’s a good question. look umm, last night we let the dice decide. maybe we should leave it up to fate again. i love you!\n\nchandler: yes, we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then there’s a definite sign that we should get married.\n\nmonica: all right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don’t get married.\n\nchandler: sounds great.\n\nmonica: okay. (they approach the craps table.)\n\ncroupler: coming in, we got a shooter! money please.\n\nmonica: ready?\n\nchandler: ready!\n\nmonica: (sarcastic) come on eight.\n\nchandler: (deadpan) yes, yes eight.\n\n(monica rolls the dice.)\n\ncroupler: eight! easy eight. (she rolls a 3 and a 5 and they’re stunned.)\n\nmonica: wow! i can’t believe i actually rolled an eight.\n\nchandler: that was so unlikely. well, let’s get married! i guess.\n\nmonica: wait a minute. that wasn’t a hard eight! last night i rolled a hard eight.\n\nchandler: that’s right! it was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! damnit!\n\nmonica: i wanted it so bad! (pause) wanna go pack?\n\nchandler: yeah. (they go pack.) we’re doing the right thing, right?\n\nmonica: ohh, of course we are! (they walk up to the elevators.) we left it up to fate. (pushes the elevator button.) if we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign. (the elevator door opens to a priest reading from a bible with chandler and monica standing side-by-side holding each other’s hands.)\n\n[scene, phoebe’s cab, phoebe and joey are driving back. phoebe is driving while joey is sleeping.]\n\nphoebe: okay, you have 19 questions left. use them wisely.
