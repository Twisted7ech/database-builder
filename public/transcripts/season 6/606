(hangs up the phone and sits down to turn on the game. he looks over at his fake son.) you know, daddy was gonna be a basketball player.\n\n[scene, rachel’s bedroom, rachel is entering carrying two glasses of wine. she gives one to phoebe, keeps one, and completely ignores monica.]\n\nphoebe: yeah, i think it was better when you guys were sad. hey, uh, remember the roller blades?\n\nrachel: you know what else i’m not gonna miss? "i’m monica. i wash the toilet 17 times a day. even if people are on it!"\n\nmonica: "hi i’m rachel, is my sweater too tight? no? oh, i’d better wash it and shrink it!"\n\nrachel: "i’m monica, i don’t get phone messages from interesting people. ever!"\n\nphoebe: hey! i call her!\n\nmonica: "oh my god, i love ross! i hate ross! i love ross! i hate ross!"\n\nrachel: "oh my god, i can’t find a boyfriend! so i guess i’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy i find in there!"\n\nphoebe: you guys come on, this is the last night!\n\nrachel: yeah, you're right-you're right, (to monica) and so for the last time i would like to ask you: boo-hoo! get out of my room!\n\n(monica picks up one of those boxes of hair curling things, dumps it in a box, and storms out.)\n\nphoebe: yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations. (phoebe dumps a drawer full of makeup into a box.)\n\n[scene, chandler and joey's, joey is examining the broken foosball table as chandler enters from his room.]\n\nchandler: still broken?\n\njoey: this sucks man! the last night you’re here and i lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.\n\nchandler: well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little blackjack? (holds up a deck of cards.)\n\njoey: nah, not my game.\n\nchandler: okay, uh, how about, how about—y’know what? we could play a new game. a new game, it’s fun.\n\njoey: well, what’s it called?\n\nchandler: cups.\n\njoey: i don’t know how to play cups.\n\nchandler: i’ll teach ya! come on, come on, it’s really easy and really, really fun.\n\njoey: all right.\n\nchandler: okay, here you go.

(pays him again.)\n\njoey: damn! i am good at cups!\n\n[scene, monica and rachel's, monica is whining to phoebe about rachel.]\n\nmonica: i’m not talking to her!\n\nphoebe: well, one of you has to take the first step! and it should be you, because she’s the one who’s leaving. it’s harder for her!\n\nmonica: well, maybe you’re right—she made fun of my phone pen!\n\nphoebe: i know, i took it hard too. she's in there right now, crying. i can hear her.\n\nmonica: (goes up to the door to listen) she's not crying.\n\nphoebe: she's holding it in. she's so brave. go.\n\n(monica goes into rachel’s room.)\n\nmonica: listen rachel, i feel really bad about—what are you doing? (she sees that rachel is unpacking.)\n\nrachel: i’m unpacking!\n\nmonica: what?!\n\nrachel: i’m not moving! (she re-hangs a picture, crookedly.) is that picture straight?\n\nmonica: it needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!\n\nrachel: hey, y’know what? you’re the one who wants to make this big change and move in with chandler! you should be the one to go! why should i have to leave?!\n\nmonica: because it’s my apartment!\n\nrachel: well it’s mine too! what else you got?!\n\nmonica: how about, you’re moving!! (grabs a bunch of clothes and throws them into a box. what follows is a brief sequence of rachel unpacking and monica packing the same stuff over and over again as rachel chants "no." and monica chants "yes.")\n\nrachel: look! this is ridiculous. we should be packing you!! (she knocks over monica, grabs a box, and runs into the kitchen.)\n\nphoebe: hey, how are you guys doing?\n\nrachel: great! monica’s moving!\n\nmonica: (entering) i am not!\n\nrachel: oh really?! then how come all your stuff is in this box?! (monica starts chasing rachel around the table.)\n\nphoebe: okay, you guys. you guys i think i know what’s going on here. okay, you guys… stop!! (they stop.) i know that, i know that you’re acting mad because you think that it’ll make it easier to leave. but deep down you’re still really sad. deep-deep down.\n\nmonica: no phoebe i am mad!\n\nphoebe: well, deep-deep-deep down!\n\nrachel: yeah, i’m just mad!\n\nphoebe: then keep running. (they resume the chase.)\n\n[scene, chandler and joey's, they’re still playing cups.]\n\nchandler: you win.\n\njoey: well, what did you have?\n\nchandler: it doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. that my friend is d-cup. okay, now much have you won so far?\n\njoey: uh, (counts the money) wow, 700.\n\nchandler: not 700 exactly?\n\njoey: yeah.\n\nchandler: double it! (he does.)\n\njoey: what?\n\nchandler: well you see in cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.\n\njoey: really?\n\nchandler: hey, i didn’t make up the rules. now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. (joey gets excited.) don’t get to excited because that’s not gonna happen unless you get—no way! (he takes the top card, which is the two of clubs. of course, any card would’ve won. chandler pays him.)\n\n[scene, monica and rachel's, monica carries a box out of rachel’s room.]\n\nmonica: well, this is the last box of your clothes. i’m just gonna label it, "what were you thinking?"\n\nrachel: funny, because i was just gonna go across the hall and write that on chandler.\n\nphoebe: hey you guys, i don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, i don’t want to live with rachel anymore.\n\nmonica and rachel: what?!\n\nphoebe: you’re just so mean to each other! and i don’t want to end up like that with rachel. i still like you!\n\nrachel: well, phoebe that’s fine because i’m not moving.\n\nmonica: whoa-whoa-whoa, phoebe you gotta take her! y’know i-i-i said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.\n\nrachel: oh really? like what monica?\n\nmonica: y’know she has 147,000 pairs of boots…\n\nrachel: oh yeah, good start mon.\n\nmonica: she lets you borrow them.\n\nrachel: yeah and you stretch ‘em out with your big old clown feet.\n\nmonica: do you wanna live outside?! because it’s gettin’ cold! (to phoebe) she gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that i’d like.\n\nphoebe: what else?\n\nmonica: when i take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.\n\nrachel: yeah, i do. i-i do, do that.\n\nphoebe: that’s nice. i like having things to read in the bathroom.\n\nmonica: when i fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.\n\nrachel: well y’know, i don’t want you to be cold.\n\nmonica: and when i told her that i was gonna be moving in with chandler, she was really supportive. (to rachel) (starts to cry) you were so great. you made it so easy. and now you have to leave. and i have to live with a boy!! (they both break down in tears.)\n\nrachel: oh, it’s gonna be fine.\n\nphoebe: okay rachel, i can’t wait to live with you! and you know what we should do? bring monica and then we could all live there together! we’ll have so much fun!!\n\nrachel: but honey, i think she’s moving in with chandler.\n\nphoebe: oh that’s right. you’re still set on that?\n\nmonica: kinda. (she hugs phoebe and looks out the window. she moves closer to it to get a better look.) oh my god!\n\n[cut to ross’s apartment, he’s watching tv and eating some popcorn as the phone rings.]\n\nross: (answering the phone) hello?
