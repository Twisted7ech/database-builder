(to rachel) who-who’s barry and mindy?\n\nrachel: barry was the guy that i was almost married and mindy was my best friend.\n\njoey: ohh-oh, wasn’t he cheating on you with her?\n\nrachel: yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.\n\nmonica: why did they get divorced?\n\nrachel: well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. isn’t that sad? (giggles.) god, could you imagine if i actually married him?! i mean how different would my life be?\n\nross: i know what you mean, i’ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if i’d never gotten divorced.\n\nphoebe: which time?\n\nross: the first time! no seriously, imagine if carol hadn’t realized she was a lesbian.\n\njoey: (starts to imagine it) i can’t. i keep seeing it the good way.\n\nross: i’d bet i’d still be doing my kara-tay. (that’s karate, he’s just saying it that way.) towards the end of our marriage i was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know, not doing anything else physical.\n\nchandler: maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.\n\nmonica: and what if i was still fat? (to chandler) well, you wouldn’t be dating me, that’s for sure.\n\nchandler: sure i would!\n\nall: (simultaneously) oh yeah! come on! yeah right!\n\nchandler: what, you guys really think that i’m that shallow?\n\nross: no, i just think monica was that fat.\n\njoey: hey, imagine if i never got fired off days of our lives!

(they start to leave.)\n\nrachel: oh wait, don’t you have to pay for your, (looks at his magazine) busty ladies?\n\nross: no, it’s okay. some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but i don’t…\n\nrachel: (laughs) oh yeah? okay.\n\nross: (putting the magazine back and holding the money for it) okay.\n\nrachel: but! don’t you have to give him his money back?\n\nross: uh-huh. (steps to a random kid nearby and hands him his money.) hey, here you go buddy. sorry, no porn for you. (to rachel) okay, let’s go see monica!\n\n[scene, central perk, joey, fat monica, and her boyfriend are sitting on the couch. monica’s boyfriend is getting up to get something. for future reference, for the rest of this episode monica’s fat, i won’t be calling her fat monica throughout.]\n\njoey: so monica, still going out with dr. boring huh?\n\nmonica: he’s not boring! he’s just-he’s just low key.\n\nmonica's boyfriend: (returning) here we go, one hazelnut latte.
