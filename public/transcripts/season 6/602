(awkward silence ensues.) seriously.\n\nrachel: i believe you. so, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me raquel! by the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me rocky!\n\nchandler: well, i-i still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty…\n\nrachel: what?\n\nchandler: (to monica) all yours babe.

(points to karin) wouldn’t you want a date?\n\nkarin: actually, i’m dating at all anymore. see, i figured out that i was only dating guys that were like y’know bad for me, so until i work that out…\n\nphoebe: (interrupting) whatever! what about you meg?\n\nmeg: well, i don’t care about the divorces either, but i wouldn’t date him. it’s just that he’s obviously still in love with this rachel girl.\n\nross: what?!\n\nphoebe: (leaning to him) she said, "he’s obviously still in love with this rachel girl." (he glares at her.)\n\nross: this is crazy! i mean, yes-yes rachel is my good friend and i-i have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?\n\nphoebe: well, i thought you loved her when you-when you married her.\n\nross: we were drunk! i would’ve married uh, joey with that amount of alcohol!\n\nphoebe: hey! you could do a lot worse than joey tribbiani!!\n\nross: (to the panel) look, i’m sorry, but you guys are wrong. i just don’t want to be divorced three times.\n\nphoebe: yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. i must say, "well done!" bravo meg.\n\nross: (getting up) okay! fine! fine! if-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! okay, i-i’ll go to my lawyer’s office right now and get this marriage annulled! okay?! because she means nothing to me! noth—(leans down to meg’s ear)—nothing!!\n\nmeg: okay now i wouldn’t date you because you seem a little creepy.\n\nkarin: i am so attracted to him right now.\n\n[scene, monica and rachel's, chandler and monica are still debating about how to tell rachel that chandler’s moving in and she’s moving out.]\n\nchandler: okay, when are we gonna tell rachel what is actually gonna happen?\n\nmonica: soon! i-i just couldn’t before. you saw how upset joey got! i couldn’t do that to her, she’s my best friend!\n\nchandler: well, joey’s my best friend.\n\nmonica: i’m not your best friend?\n\nchandler: you just said… of course you’re my best friend. would you please tell rachel though?\n\nmonica: all right, all right, at least i’m prepared.\n\nchandler: okay. (she grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) oh yes. (he reaches for one.)\n\nmonica: (slapping his hand) hey!\n\nchandler: hey-hey!\n\nmonica: these aren’t for you! are you upset?\n\nchandler: i am now!\n\nrachel: (entering) hey roomie!\n\nchandler: okay, bye! (exits.)\n\nmonica: rach, there’s something uh, important i have to tell you.\n\nrachel: (gasps) are you pregnant?!\n\nmonica: no! but, i’m throwing this shirt away! i think there was a little misunderstanding before.\n\nrachel: um-hmm.\n\nmonica: umm, when i said that uh, that chandler and i wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.\n\nrachel: (laughs) oh my god! oh, that’s funny, i can’t believe i did that.\n\nmonica: oh no sweetie, no! this is my fault, i wasn’t clear! i’m really sorry. and listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? there’s absolutely no rush.\n\nrachel: okay. (sits back and resumes her reading.)\n\nmonica: okay. don’t you want a cookie?\n\nrachel: sure? (monica hands her one.) thanks.\n\nmonica: maybe, do you need a tissue?\n\n(rachel mumbles uh-huh and spits the half-eaten cookie out onto the tissue.)\n\nrachel: monica, where did you get these?!\n\nmonica: i made them!\n\nrachel: ooh, good god, they’re so yummy! (she re-ingests the previously expelled cookie matter from the tissue.)\n\n[scene, chandler and joey's, chandler is packing some books and joey is watching him.]\n\njoey: god, it’s gonna so weird like when i come home and you’re not here. y’know? no more joey and chan’s. no more j and c’s. "you wanna go over to joey and chandler’s?" "can’t, its not there."\n\nchandler: look, i’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.\n\njoey: yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.\n\nchandler: not once did we do that.\n\nmonica: (entering) hi.\n\nchandler: hey!\n\njoey: hi.\n\nmonica: so i, i told rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.\n\nchandler: oh yeah? well, how’d she take it?\n\nmonica: really well. yeah. surprisingly well. yeah, she didn’t cry. she wasn’t angry or sad. (sits down, slightly disgusted.)\n\nchandler: and you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?\n\nmonica: i mean, all i’m asking for is just a little emotion! is that too much to ask after six years?! i mean what? are-are-are rachel and i not as close as you guys?! i mean do we not have as much fun?! don’t i deserve a few tears?!! i mean we-we told joey, he cried his eyes out!\n\njoey: hey! i did not cry my eyes out!! come on! it’s like the end of an era! no more j-man and channie’s!!\n\nchandler: okay, i gotta ask, who calls us that?!\n\n[scene, ross’s lawyer’s office, his name is russell and has just been told by ross about his current situation.]\n\nrussell: you got married again.\n\nross: yes.\n\nrussell: so that’s your second marriage in two years.\n\nross: yes, second in two years. third overall.\n\nrussell: ross, i have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had i so much business from one client. why don’t you tell me what happened.\n\nross: basically, rachel and i were in vegas and we got drunk…\n\nrussell: (interrupting) i’m sorry, is this the same rachel who’s name you said at the altar in the second marriage?\n\nross: yes-yes-yes! but, i-i do not love her.\n\nrussell: oh, that’s better then.\n\nross: this was just a drunken mistake and i need to get it annulled.\n\nrussell: i see. have you considered therapy?\n\nross: i think just the annulment for today.\n\nrussell: there are a couple of forms to fill out.\n\nross: easy.\n\nrussell: and we’ll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.\n\nross: no problem.\n\nrussell: and we’ll need you and rachel to testify before a judge.\n\nross: ooh! there’s no way to do this without her? ‘cause i kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.\n\nrussell: of course you did. look ross, you can’t get an annulment unless you and rachel are both there.\n\nross: uh-ha, what about someone who looks like rachel? (russell glares at him.) i will think about the therapy.\n\n[scene, monica and rachel's, rachel is painting her toe nails as monica enters.]\n\nrachel: hey!\n\nmonica: hey. so um, i was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.\n\nrachel: okay!\n\nmonica: y’know, no point in dragging it out. dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.\n\nrachel: okay.\n\nmonica: hey rach, what about this?
