(the customer gets up and starts to leave.) go! (customer exits.)\n\n[scene, monica and chandler's, chandler and ross are both pouting and sitting on the couch.]\n\nross: it’s my joke.\n\nchandler: it’s my joke.\n\nross and chandler: it’s my joke.\n\nross: y’know, i don’t think we’re going to settle this.\n\nchandler: let’s have monica decide.\n\nross: yeah!\n\nchandler: yeah!\n\nross: hey mon.\n\nchandler: mon, get out here!\n\nross: monica! (she appears, not sure why she was summoned.)\n\nchandler: okay, okay. you have to help us decide whose joke this is.\n\nmonica: why do i have to decide?\n\nchandler: because you’re the only one that can be fair.\n\nross: yeah.\n\nmonica: i can’t be fair. you’re my boyfriend.\n\nross: yeah, but i’m your brother. we’re family. that’s the most important thing in the world.\n\nchandler: (to ross) don’t try to sway her. (to monica) (softly) i’m your only chance to have a baby. okay, let’s go.\n\nross: we’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.\n\nmonica: okay, chandler, you go first.\n\nchandler: okay, i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve.\n\nmonica: oh, wait, is he the guy i met at christmas?\n\nchandler: can i finish my story?!\n\nmonica: do you want me to pick you?!\n\nross: see, i would never snap at you like that.\n\n(chandler motions to monica that he’ll give her two babies.)\n\nmonica: continue.\n\nchandler: so steve said he had to go to the doctor. and steve’s doctor’s name is doctor muppy. so i said, ‘doctor monkey?’ and that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up. (he slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his point.)\n\nross: are you kidding? okay, look. i-i studied evolution. remember, evolution? monkey into man? plus, i’m a doctor, and i had a monkey. i’m doctor monkey!\n\nchandler: i’m not arguing with that.\n\nmonica: all right, i’ve heard enough. i’ve made my decision.\n\n(both chandler and ross are eager to hear her decision.)\n\nmonica: you are both idiots. the joke is not funny, and it’s offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! you shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! now let it go! the joke sucks!\n\n(monica leaves the room)\n\nross: it’s your joke.\n\nchandler: is not.\n\n[scene, central perk, rachel is sitting at a table and phoebe is on the couch. chandler and monica can be seen outside, she’s lecturing him, and pushes him inside. he then nods to rachel, and is obviously counting off the seconds in his head and then monica makes a grand entrance.]\n\nmonica: hi, chandler. there you are.\n\nchandler: hi, oh hi.\n\nmonica: hey, it’s phoebe and rachel. um, why don’t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?\n\n(rachel and phoebe exchange looks.)\n\nchandler: (starts to recite a rehearsed speech) monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. (pause.) being with her has been like being on a vacation. and what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and—(he falters and monica prompts him.)—generosity of spirit.\n\nrachel: wow, you know what? that is the best fake speech i think i’ve ever heard.\n\nphoebe: really? i’ve heard better.\n\nmonica: wait, wait, he came up with that himself. tell them, chandler.\n\nchandler: (to chandler) i’m out of words. should i just say the whole thing again?\n\nmonica: look, i am not high maintenance. i am not. chandler!\n\nchandler: (pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) you’re a little high maintenance.\n\nmonica: ahhh! you are on my list.\n\nchandler: i’m sorry. you’re not easy-going, but you’re passionate, and that’s good. and when you get upset about the little things, i think that i’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. and that’s good too. so, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because i like … maintaining you.\n\nmonica: (embarrassed) (to phoebe and rachel) i didn’t even tell him to say that. (they hug). all right you’re off my list.\n\nchandler: (happily) i’m off the list. (sits on the couch.)\n\nmonica: (sits next to him) phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because i have the best boyfriend.\n\nphoebe: (to monica) y’know, suddenly i find you very attractive.\n\n(joey enters.)\n\nchandler: hey, buddy boy, how’d the audition go?\n\njoey: not good, no. i didn’t get the part, and i lost my job here, so …\n\nphoebe: wow! that is a bad audition.\n\nrachel: how-how did you lose your job here?\n\njoey: well, i had the audition but gunther said i had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. so, i went anyway, and then he fired me.\n\nrachel: he left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? that’s not, that’s not right.\n\njoey: yeah, what are ya gonna do?\n\nrachel: joey, you can’t let him get away with that. ya know what, i’m not going to let him get away with that. i’m going to say something to him—no, i really shouldn’t say anything—no, i should say something to him. (goes to the counter) gunther, i want you to give joey his job back. that is really not fair that you have to fire him…\n\ngunther: okay.\n\nrachel: what?\n\ngunther: he can have his job back.\n\nrachel: that’s right, he can have his job back. i’m glad we got that all straightened out. there you go, joey, you got your job back.\n\njoey: that’s great. thanks rach.\n\nrachel: yeah, pretty nice, huh? now who’s a pushover?\n\nphoebe: (returning from the bathroom) rach, you’re in my seat.\n\nrachel: oh, i’m sorry. (gets up and moves.)\n\nending credits\n\n[scene, monica and chandler's, monica, phoebe, and rachel are sitting at the kitchen table, talking.]\n\nphoebe: hey, i never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.\n\nmonica: i pick you, phoebe.\n\nrachel: oh, yeah. definitely you, pheebs.\n\nphoebe: yeah, well, i kinda thought.\n\n(phoebe gets up from the table, and while her back is turned, rachel and monica indicate via sign language that they each would have picked the other.)\n\n(joey, chandler and ross enter.)\n\nchandler: hey.\n\nrachel: hey. oh, i have a question. if-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?\n\nross: no way.\n\njoey: i’m not answering that.\n\nchandler: joey!
