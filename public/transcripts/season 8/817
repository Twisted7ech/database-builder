(looks at the leaves.) ooh, i see a ladder. (checks the book) which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.\n\nmonica: (stunned) i-i'm the head chef. i-i can't get promoted.\n\nphoebe: uh-hmm. uh-hmm, who's next?\n\nrachel: okay, i'm done. do mine.\n\nphoebe: okay.

(checks the book.) wow! yay! ooh, i'm gonna meet a guy! and really soon! and he's gonna be the man of my dreams. probably not the guy i had a dream about last night.

(walks away.)\n\nphoebe: (noticing a guy sitting by the green post looking at her) oh wait a second you guys…for the last couple weeks i've been that guy everywhere i go. we take the same bus. we go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he's the tea guy. (he gets up to leave, and smiles at phoebe.)\n\nchandler: phoebe, did you see that?! he totally checked you out! he is so cute! (looking at his tea.) mine has a picture of the village people, what does that mean?\n\n(joey enters.)\n\nrachel: hi!\n\njoey: hey.\n\n(he slowly walks to the other side of the couch and sits down at the table, an awkward silence follows.)\n\nrachel: hi.\n\njoey: hi.\n\n(more awkward silence.)\n\nmonica: tea gives phoebe the trots.\n\n[scene, monica and chandler's, chandler is cooking as rachel paces nervously.]\n\nrachel: so i thought joey and i would be okay once we hung out, but it's not even like we know how to be with each other anymore. and by the way, i've been meaning to say this. if you guys knew about this a little heads-up would've been nice. just a little. you know "joey loves you, be prepared".\n\nmonica: sorry.\n\nrachel: well, for next time.\n\nchandler: i know it's tough now, but things will get better.\n\nrachel: how do you know that? what if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can't even be in the same room with each other?!\n\nchandler: i'm not great at the advice, can i interest you in a sarcastic comment? some cheese?\n\nmonica: honey, what is the bruce springsteen cd in the kat stevens case?\n\nchandler: let's just say if i can't find the right cd case i just put it in the nearest one.\n\nmonica: okay, where is the kat stevens cd?\n\nchandler: in the james taylor case.\n\nmonica: where is the james taylor cd?\n\nchandler: honey, i'm gonna save you some time, 200 cds, not one of them in the right case.\n\nmonica: okay. no need to panic. deep breathes everyone. okay umm uh, we're just gonna have to spend some time and put the cds in the right cases.\n\nchandler: well, if we're gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. y'know alphabetically or by genre?\n\nmonica: hmm, i don't know. we really have to talk this through.\n\nrachel: oh my god!! you guys have such problems!! i feel so terrible for you!\n\nmonica: okay, i-i'm sorry. you and joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.\n\nrachel: oh yeah. that makes sense.\n\nmonica: yeah, like i don't know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.\n\nrachel: ooh, i can do that.\n\nmonica: good.

(pause) see uh my-my boss and his wife—they-they can't have children. so umm, and that—we were at the christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "rachel, i want to buy your baby."\n\njoey: man! when you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby i figured it was something about maternity leave.\n\nrachel: ohh! yeah! (pause) yeah that-that would've been a much simpler problem.\n\n[scene, a newsstand, phoebe is looking at a magazine as the guy from before walks by and picks up a newspaper.]\n\nphoebe: oh hello.\n\nguy: oh, it's you. i see you everywhere. i'm jim, jim nelson.\n\nphoebe: oh jim, jim nelson i'm phoebe, phoebe buffay. we certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.\n\njim: we have. maybe we'll be seeing each other at dinner tomorrow night, say around 8 o'clock?\n\nphoebe: well, maybe we will.

(there's no answer, so he starts to leave but remembers where her extra key is. he reaches atop a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key. he looks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to his brain, and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth to squeal in pain. after dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses the key to open the door and enter mona's apartment.) okay, if i were a salmon shirt, where would i be? (thinks of and answer) upstream. damn, nobody's here for my good ones. (he hears a key in the door and as it opens he dives behind the couch.)\n\nmona: (entering, with her date) i am so sorry i spilled wine all over your shirt.\n\nmona's date: oh, it's okay.\n\nmona: no, it's still wet. y'know what? let me get it out before it sets. ooh, i have something you can wear. here.
