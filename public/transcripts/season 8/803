(he takes the picture and hugs her.\n\nend\n\nscrolling caption: the following scenes were deleted from the episode "the one where rachel tells ross" and are being presented here for the first time. the story involved chandler joking with security at an airport and was to air two weeks after the events of september 11, 2001. in light of this, we decided to replace the original story, as part of the history of the show, we hope that the scenes can now be viewed in the spirit which they were originally intended.\n\n[scene, the airport check-in desk. monica and chandler are standing in line.]\n\nchandler: no problems getting a cab, no traffic. my way totally works.\n\nmonica: yeah, i feel totally relaxed, totally calm (the guy in front of them moves off) go go go!!!!\n\n(she pushes chandler towards he desk)\n\nticket agent: {transcribes note: its the same actress as used in the broadcasted version} lets see, your on the flight to nassau. mr. bing, you'll be in 25j, and mrs. bing, you'll be in 25k.\n\nmonica: (laughs) mrs. bing\n\nticket agent: i is s funny name.\n\nchandler: she's not laughing at the name. we just  got married, we're going on your honeymoon.\n\nticket agent: oh, really. congratulations. you know what, let me see what i can do. there was a cancellation, i can bump you up to first class.\n\nchandler: wow, thank you. (to monica) you see, if we gotten here earlier, those seats might not have been available. compromise works.\n\nmonica: my name is mrs. bing. haven't i compromised enough?\n\n[scene, the metal detector at the airport. monica is taking off anything that could set the alarm off]\n\na guy standing behind them: could you hurry up?\n\nmonica: hey, i've never set one of these off before, and i'm not about to start now. (starts to walk, but them realises something) oh one sec. (she takes off her anklet, then to the security officer.) my anklet, that was a close one. (she walks through the detector and it doesn't go off) yes!!!\n\n(chandler casually strolls through. he sees a sign about airport security.)\n\nchandler: hey look at that. (reading) "federal law prohibits any joking regarding aircraft high-jacking or bombing". (to the security officer.) you don't have anything to worry about ma'am, i take my bombs very seriously.\n\npolice officer: (coming in from out of shot, and grabbing chandler) sir you wanna come with us?\n\nmonica: no wait, chandler wait! (she grabs her bag and runs through the metal detector.) that doesn't count! backwards doesn't count! (she runs after chandler)\n\n[scene, the interrogation room. monica and chandler are sitting down, and two officers are questioning them]\n\nchandler: look, this is ridiculous. i was just making a joke. i mean i know the sign says "no jokes about bombs", but shouldn't it say "no bombs"? i mean, isn't that the guy we really have to worry about here? the guy with the bombs? not the guy who jokes about his bombs? not that i have bombs. i i did, i probably wouldn't joke about them. i'd probably wanna keep that rather quite. i'm sorry, you had some questions fro me?\n\nofficer #1: miss, what is our association with this man?\n\nmonica: he's my husband\n\nofficer #1: i see.\n\nmonica: but only for a few days, i mean, i don't know what he does when he's outside the house.\n\nchandler: thank you darling. (to the officers) you see, this is the first time we're travelling "my way" so its very important that we make this flight. it's no of those "her plan versus my plan" kinda things.\n\nofficer #2: what do you mean my "plan"?\n\nchandler: you should really just ask me yes or no questions.\n\n(the first officer picks up monica's suitcase.)\n\nmonica: oh, er... no, that's not hi bag, that's my bag.\n\nofficer #2: it's just procedure.\n\nmonica: no, no, no... you don't understand. you see, everything is packed perfectly. it took me forever to do this. there's like over 50 folded pieces. (he starts randomly taking pieces out) you're mean.\n\n[scene, the interrogation room. it's a bit later and the officers have finished.]\n\nofficer #1: alright, you're free to go.\n\nchandler: thanks you. thanks. and listen, about those speedo's, i don't know how they go in there.\n\n(they leave the room, and monica's phone rings)\n\njoey: (from inside monica and chandler's apartment) hey, it's joey. listen, phoebe and i smell gas coming from your apartment.\n\nmonica: what? are you serious?
