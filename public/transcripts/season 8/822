(gets up from the green armchair.)\n\nrachel: you. like you haven't done enough.\n\nross: look, i-i know how miserable you are, i wish there was something i can do. i mean i wish i were a seahorse. (she glares at him) because with seahorses it's the male, they carry the babies. and then also umm, i'd be far away in the sea. (he sits back down.)\n\n(rachel turns and looks at the group on the couch and they move over. chandler measures the room they've made with his arm and decides it's not enough and they all move over again.)\n\nrachel: god. (sits down.) i have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!\n\nphoebe: oh i know, i've been there. i remember toward the end…\n\nrachel: (interrupting her) oh phoebe, that's a great story. can you tell it to me when you're getting me some iced tea?

(points to her stomach just above her belly button.)\n\nchandler: i haven't seen this dress.\n\nmonica: star in a movie.\n\nphoebe: joey, you pick who ever you want. okay? you just listen to your heart. what does it tell you?

(mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor going off.)\n\nchandler: you really want to take me?\n\njoey: yeah! yeah! i mean i'm sorry, i wish i can take everybody, but y'know chandler always supported my career. he's paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.\n\nchandler: so you're never actually going to pay me back?\n\nmonica: wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you're gonna take him? joey, i don't think you're comprehending just how slutty this dress is!\n\njoey: it's not just the stuff he paid for, i mean it's-it's everything. y'know? he read lines with me. he-he went with me on auditions when i was really nervous, and then he consoled me after i didn't get parts that i really wanted. you always believed in me man. even, even when i didn't believe in myself.\n\nchandler: i always knew you were gonna make it. i'm so proud of you.\n\njoey: thanks. that means a lot to me.\n\n(they look at each other and smile for a while.)\n\nphoebe: mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.\n\njoey: (in a manly voice) i'm gonna go shave. (gets up.)\n\nchandler: (in a manly voice) yeah well, i'm gonna go spit. (he goes into the bedroom. on his way out, joey gives rachel a wide berth.)\n\nrachel: oh, i have to pee. if i don't come out in five minutes it's because i've choked to death on the potpourri stink. (goes into the bathroom.)\n\nphoebe: when she comes out, you hold her nose, i'll blow in her mouth, and the kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her.\n\nmonica: she's over a week late! she gotta have it today, right?\n\nphoebe: i don't know. i-i think it's still gonna be a while.\n\nmonica: hmm, care to make it interesting? i'll bet you that she'll have it by this time tomorrow.\n\nphoebe: you're on!\n\nmonica: okay, how much?\n\nphoebe: one hundred thousand dollars!\n\nmonica: how about fifty bucks?\n\nphoebe: fine! i'll call zurich and move some money around.\n\nrachel: (calling from the bathroom) all right, who's turn is it to help me get up!\n\n(they both look at each other, then phoebe gets an idea.)\n\nphoebe: no one's here!

(chandler does so) there you go. (and they walk down the red carpet.)\n\nchandler: it's just so glamorous.\n\n[scene, monica and chandler's, rachel is entering, still pregnant.]\n\nphoebe: oh hey mon? rach is here! ohh, you're still pregnant. oh, i'm sorry. i know how uncomfortable you are. y'know what? you look great. yeah, like fifty bucks.\n\nrachel: oh, i have to go pee. apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy. (goes to the bathroom.)\n\nmonica: damnit! damnit!! here's your fifty bucks!

(to herself) do i have to pee again? (waits to tell) no i'm good.\n\nross: uh, do you wanna go change first? the doctor's keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry…\n\nrachel: no, i'm fine.\n\nross: really? you don't think that's a little inappropriate. (she's wearing a tank top and has her belly sticking out.)\n\nphoebe: good god man don't anger it.\n\nrachel: ross, it is 100 degrees outside. for the first time in weeks, i am somewhat comfortable.\n\nross: fine! fine! y'know what? whatever you want. okay? you're the mommy.\n\nrachel: oh uh-uh pal! don't call me mommy! it's bad enough you call your own mother that.

(pause) seriously, breathe louder ross! that's great!\n\nross: y'know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that's half human and half pure evil!\n\n(dr. long enters.)\n\nrachel: hi dr. long, how are you?\n\nross: (to rachel) oh, you're nice to her.\n\nrachel: she has the drugs!\n\ndr. long: we'll do a quick check.\n\nrachel: okay.
