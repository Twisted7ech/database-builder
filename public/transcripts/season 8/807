(sits down on the couch.) oh i got it! i got it. (puts his hands to his eyes.)\n\nphoebe: no don't tear out your eyes!!\n\neric: i was just, i was just gonna take out my lenses.\n\nphoebe: oh, yeah try that. (he finishes and looks at her.) so, is that better?\n\neric: not really. you…you're blurry, but you still look like ursula. you're blursula. okay wait. maybe…if i-if i just don't look at you for a while. (stands up and turns his back to her.) see? it…it works. i'm not, i'm not angry at all anymore! this is a great date!\n\nphoebe: yeah, not so much. it's kinda hard to have a conversation.\n\neric: no, sure we can have a conversation. um... tell me a little about yourself.\n\nphoebe: (looks around for who he's talking to) oh me? look eric, turn around. (he does so.) look, i like you, but it shouldn't be this hard. y'know? this is our first date y'know? first dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and ‘ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?' and y'know first kisses and…(he kisses her)…second kisses.
