(ross opens the door for her and she leaves.)\n\nross: should i leave this open for you too?\n\nmona: i'm not sure yet. why didn't you just tell me about all this?\n\nross: because what's going on with rachel has nothing to do with how i feel about you.\n\nmona: yeah? well you still shoulda told me.\n\nross: i know and i was going to, but i thought it was better that you heard it from rachel's father. look i…i made a mistake, but it's only because i really, really like you. really!\n\nmona: okay, i guess you can…close the door now.
