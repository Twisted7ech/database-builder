(phoebe has no comeback.) i just wanted so much to…be impulsive once. to be romantic.\n\nphoebe: that’s good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. just…you did it with the wrong person. (he looks at her.) what?\n\neric: it’s just so weird, two people look so much alike, and so different.\n\nursula: (yelling from downstairs) eric!! let’s go!!\n\neric: i’d better go, deal…\n\nphoebe: yeah, you should. (they shake hands.)\n\nursula: hurry up i gotta pray!!\n\n(phoebe hands eric ursula’s purse and he walks away.)\n\n[time lapse: rachel is returning from chasing down the boy in the cape.]\n\njoey: hey!\n\nrachel: hey! well, i had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.\n\njoey: that’s not so bad.\n\nrachel: no, i also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. oh, i am just awful with children!\n\njoey: come on! you’re good with kids. they’re just crazy on halloween. y’know, they’re all greedy and hopped up on sugar!\n\nrachel: really? you think that’s all it is?\n\njoey: absolutely! halloween is the worst. except for christmas…and their birthdays. kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. and anytime they’re hungry or sleepy. y’know, kids are tough. good luck with that.
