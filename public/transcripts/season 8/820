"i’m tired, you take care of it." which i later said to him when he wanted to have sex.\n\nross: well, i’m not rachel’s dad. and no offense, but he’s an ass.\n\nmrs. green: i do like you ross.\n\nross: look, i have a son. and his mother and i didn’t live together, and whenever he was with me i took care of him all the time, by myself.\n\nmrs. green: that’s true. you do have another child.\n\nross: yeah.\n\nmrs. green: with another woman. have you no control ross?\n\nross: that’s a different issue. uh, the point is, when the baby comes i will be there to…to feed her and bathe her and change her. and more than that i want to do all those things.\n\nmrs. green: well then you really don’t need me to live with you.\n\nross: yes! yes, you’re gonna be so missed.\n\nmrs. green: you’re gonna be a great father.\n\nross: well you’re gonna be a wonderful grandma.

(to phoebe) what do i do?\n\nphoebe: nothing! you have apologized to her like a million times and she’s been nothing but terrible to you. and don’t forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn’t even thanked you for it.\n\nmonica: y’know what? you’re-you’re right.\n\nphoebe: yeah i mean if you want to say anything to her, i’d tell her off.\n\nmonica: really?\n\nphoebe: uh-huh!\n\nmonica: okay! i will! mrs. green? mrs. green! (she ignores monica and monica follows her out into the hall with phoebe in tow.) it is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! now what i did to you, it wasn’t on purpose! but what you’re during to me now is just plain spiteful!\n\nmrs. green: spiteful?!\n\nmonica: that’s right! maybe it’s time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady…old lady…lady!\n\nphoebe: (to monica) wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up…\n\nmonica: so whenever you’re ready to apologize to me, i will forgive you. good day!
