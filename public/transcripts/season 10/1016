(she's holding the present, a transparent bag with a white stick in it). what is this?\n\nphoebe: it's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the dna to create your own pheebs!\n\nrachel: i'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!\n\n \n\n[scene, monica's apartment. the living room.]\n\nmonica: chandler? i was just in our bedroom and i found these (she holds the furry handcuffs) on my pillow.\n\nchandler: oh, yes. i decided to leave these out for you in case richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!\n\nmonica: what are you talking about? these aren't mine.\n\nchandler: oh yeah, right! good luck getting another scarf dance from me!\n\nmonica: that would be a terrible punishment. but, i'm serious, i've never seen these before.\n\nchandler: really? then what are they doing in our guestroom?\n\nmonica: rachel used to live in that room.\n\nchandler: rachel... with handcuffs! interesting!

(to phoebe) you don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?\n\nphoebe: where do you think mike really is? (she giggles, chandler looks aghast)\n\n \n\n[scene, the guest bedroom. chandler and rachel.]\n\nrachel: oh honey...\n\nchandler: let me just say something... because once we get into this, i'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... i just want to say that i... i love you... and, i'm gonna miss you. and i'm so sad that you're leaving.\n\nrachel: (all mushy) oh, you know what? let's not say anything else. i love you. (they hug)\n\nchandler: ooh, not so tight... (blows raspberry, and the hug ends) i'm sorry, just give me one more chance.\n\nrachel: okay. oh...\n\n(chandler blows raspberry again)\n\nrachel: oh!\n\nchandler: i'm sor... just go. just go. i can't, i can't.\n\n \n\n[scene, monica's living room. we look outside to the balcony where rachel is saying goodbye to joey.]\n\nmonica: (to ross) so, i guess you're next. you're ready?\n\nross: i don't think so.\n\nchandler: oh, you're definately not. i haven't cried like that in years.\n\nmonica: you cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.\n\nchandler: that old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.\n\nross: god! i can't believe she saved me for last. (looking out to the balcony) why are they taking so long?\n\nphoebe: i don't know. but, god, joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.\n\n(rachel and joey hug, and rachel turns to enter the apartment through the side window again. at that moment joey tries to climb over the edge of the balcony.)\n\nall: no, no, no, no!\n\n(rachel rushes back and pulls joey back onto the balcony, and takes him inside.)\n\nross: okay, here we go...\n\nrachel: oh... (holding ross's shoulder) well...\n\nross: yeah...\n\nrachel: i think i'm gonna take off. (pats ross on his back, but he looks very surprised)\n\nross: huh?\n\nrachel: oh, you guys. this was an amazing night. thank you so much. i love you. good night.\n\n(she leaves the apartment and they all stare at ross)\n\nross: what? i don't get a goodbye?\n\njoey: (still very emotional) lucky bastard!\n\n \n\n[scene, monica's apartment continued... phoebe, chandler, monica and joey are sitting down and ross is pacing up and down.]\n\nross: unbelievable. she says goodbye to everyone but me.\n\nmonica: well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.\n\nross: well, it needs to be plicit.\n\njoey: all right, let's think about this. i mean, there's got to be an explanation. uh... did you do anything to make her mad?\n\nross: no, i don't think so.\n\nphoebe: you know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. it was pretty intense.\n\nmonica: yeah. mine too.\n\nchandler: mine was a humdinger\n\nross: (annoyed) o-kay... i mean, don't i deserve anything? i mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? (joey gives ross a hug) not from you! (joey lets go)\n\nphoebe: ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.\n\nmonica: and say what? "you owe me a goodbye", i mean, he's got more pride than that.\n\nross: the hell i do!\n\n(ross takes big steps leaving for joey and rachel's apartment, where rachel is going through her papers.)\n\nross: i don't get a goodbye?\n\nrachel: what?\n\nross: (talking agitated and angry) everyone gets a goodbye but me? what have i got to do to get a goodbye, huh? be best friends with you? uh, go out with you? have a baby with you? oh wait a minute, wait a minute, i did all those things.\n\nrachel: ross...\n\nross: oh no, maybe it's me, i'm just not giving you enough credit. uh, i mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... (makes choking noises) it's physically impossible. you know what? after all we've been through, i can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. have a, have a good time in paris. (he leaves the apartment. rachel looks kind of desperate.)\n\n \n\n[scene, monica and chandler's apartment. the others are still there.]\n\nmonica: i hope ross isn't too upset.\n\njoey: i'm sure he's not more bummed out than i am.\n\nphoebe: tell me about it.\n\nchandler: well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.\n\nphoebe: all right, i think i'm gonna head out.\n\nmonica: uh, where do you think you're going?\n\nphoebe: i thought i was going home to go to bed, but i'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.\n\nmonica: we're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. it would be great if you guys could pitch in.\n\nchandler: joey and i can finish up in the guest room.\n\njoey: oh, yeah, yeah, good idea. (he mimes hitting his head with his fist)\n\nmonica: oh no! you and phoebe are gonna help me in here.\n\nchandler: (to joey) you couldn't be cool. (he goes to the guest bedroom)\n\nmonica: okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. the silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. got it?\n\nphoebe and joey: yeah.\n\nmonica: good! now i need you to be careful and efficient. and remember, if i am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.\n\nchandler: hey mon, i think i figured out whose handcuffs they are.\n\nmonica: you did? how?\n\nchandler: well, i was cleaning out the closet and i found some pictures of them... being used.\n\nmonica: oh my god! let me see.
