(she holds chandler hands) healing hands.\n\nerica: reverend, can i ask? does the bible say anything about adoption?\n\nmonica: it says “do it!”. and behold she did adopt onto them a baby. and it was good.\n\nerica: wow.\n\nchandler: yeah, wow.\n\nerica: i was wondering you both have such serious jobs. (to monica) would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?\n\nmonica: oh, you know, my flock is good, i mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. good flock. flock, flock, flock.\n\nerica: (to chandler) being a doctor must take up a lot of time.\n\nchandler: no-ot for me it doesn’t.\n\n(the agency guy enters the room)\n\nagency guy: so, how’s everything going in here?\n\nerica: we’re great, i think i may have asked all my questions.\n\nagency guy: do you have any question for erica?\n\nchandler: yeah, actually. so, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?\n\nagency guy: yes, our system assures total anonimity. we’re very proud of it.\n\nchandler: you should be. you’re really on top of stuff..\n\nagency guy: (to erica) well, then if there’s nothing else, then the two of us should talk.\n\nerica: actually, i don’t think we have to.\n\nmonica: we don’t?\n\nerica: yeah, when i read about you two, i was pretty sure i wanted you, but i just thought we should meet face to face.

(walks away again, but chandler catches up with her again)\n\nchandler: but you did like us. and you should. my wife's an incredible woman. she's loving and devoted and caring. and don't tell her i said this but the woman's always right... i love my wife more than anything in this world. and i... it kills me that i can't give her a baby... i really want a kid. and when that day finally comes, i'll learn how to be a good dad. but my wife... she's already there. she's a mother... without a baby... please?\n\n(they look at each other. we switch back to monica. chandler opens the door and she turns to look at him.)\n\nchandler: you still want that baby?\n\n(monica plays those words back in her mind and then smiles and runs to chandler, who is twisting with joy. they hug.)\n\nmonica: god bless you chandler bing!\n\ncommercial break\n\n[scene, central perk. joey's on the couch when ross walks to him, with his jacket closed.]\n\nross: turns out this sweater is made for a woman.\n\njoey: (nods) so, why are you still wearing it?\n\nross: because it's soft... hey, so how was your date?\n\njoey: ooh... not so good.\n\nross: well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?\n\njoey: yeah, and you know what? we could do a lot worse.\n\n(they shake hands the way friends would. there's a muffin on the table, and ross breaks off a piece and wants to put it in his mouth.)\n\njoey: (shouting to ross) joey doesn't share food!\n\n(ross puts the piece back on the plate)
