(starts feeling around him like he's in a completely dark room, touching chandler, who backs out and hits him)\n\nmonica: no it's not!\n\njoey: (squinting his eyes) are you kiddin'? i think i just saw a bat in the corner!\n\nchandler: when your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?\n\njoey: (glares at him for a moment, then admits grudgingly) maybe. well, i just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? or any other house for that matter.\n\nmonica: oh joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.\n\njoey: fine, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? i just hope you get used to that weird humming sound.
