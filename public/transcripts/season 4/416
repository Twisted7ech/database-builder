(you thought i was going to say ross, didn't you?) rachel squeals in delight and starts a slow sexy crawl over to joshua, making sure he and everyone else watching gets a good look at her cleavage.)\n\nphoebe: oh my god!! the baby just kicked!\n\nall: ohh!\n\nrachel: it's okay! it's okay! it kicked once, it'll kick again!\n\nall: oh my god!\n\n(they all stand up and go over to phoebe to feel the baby, preventing rachel from kissing joshua.)\n\nrachel: all right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.\n\n(she crawls over to joshua and kisses the back of his knee. he feels it and looks down, rachel pretends she's knocking a bug off his leg.)\n\nrachel: just a bug.\n\ncommercial break\n\n[scene, monica and rachel's erm, chandler and joey's, it is later in the party. the spin the bottle game is over and chandler is making a sandwich as phoebe watches.]\n\nphoebe: y'know it doesn't matter how much i'm craving it. y'know why i'm never gonna eat meat? because it's murder, cold blooded murder.\n\nchandler: okay.\n\n(he takes a bite out of the sandwich and as he does so, phoebe attacks the other end and starts devouring the sandwich.)\n\nchandler: there's a phoebe on my sandwich! (he walks away, giving the sandwich to phoebe.)\n\njoey: phoebe, what-what are you doing?!\n\nphoebe: i can't help it. i need the meat. the baby needs the meat.\n\njoey: all right look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?\n\nphoebe: yeah, totally!\n\njoey: all right. okay. well this is the same kind of deal. if you're going to do something wrong, (he grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right!\n\n[cut to later, phoebe is finishing off her steak.]\n\njoey: feel better now?\n\nphoebe: yeah, but at what cost? six more months, three meals a day, i'm gonna eat like, y'know millions of cows.\n\njoey: hey, what if i said, i could even things out for ya, meatwise.\n\nphoebe: what?\n\njoey: well, i eat a lot of meat right?\n\nphoebe: yeah.\n\njoey: well, suppose until the baby's born i laid off it. no extra animals would die, you-you'd just be eating my animals.\n\nphoebe: joey, i can't believe you would do that for me.\n\njoey: absolutely! i could be a vegetarian. there's no meat in beer, right?\n\n[cut to ross and emily standing by the foosball table.]\n\nross: okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.\n\n(rachel enters, she has changed once again. this time into her high school cheerleading uniform.)\n\nemily: but, we can't go now. it looks like rachel's gonna put on a skit.\n\nmonica: oh my god! have you lost your mind?\n\nrachel: no-n-n-n-no! i am finally thinking clearly. my lucky dress wasn't working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.\n\nmonica: rachel-rachel-rachel i-i cannot, i can't let—(pause), actually i kinda want to see what happens.\n\njoshua: hey!\n\nrachel: hi!\n\njoshua: nice uh, costume.\n\nrachel: ohh, yeah, well i wanted to give emily a big american good-bye cheer. so okay!
