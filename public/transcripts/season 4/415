(ross laughs and takes her back.)\n\nross: oh, liam. so uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something—or should i call it (in an english accent) football?\n\ndevon: we were playing rugby.\n\nliam: in fact we’re playing a game at the park tomorrow. you’re welcome to play too if you want.\n\nemily: (laughs) ross play rugby? i don’t think so.\n\nross: what’s ah, what’s so funny about that?\n\nemily: well i mean, you’re american to start with. you don’t even have rugby here.\n\nross: well, we didn’t have freedom here until 1776, either so…\n\ndevon: so good then! we’ll see you at riverside park at 2:00! cheers!\n\nliam: cheers!\n\nross: cheers!\n\n(liam and devon both take a swig of their beers, while ross takes a swig of his coffee. the brits both crush their cans, and not to be out done, ross crushes his coffee cup, spilling its contents.)\n\n[scene, central perk, chandler is attempting his pre-emptive strike.]\n\njanice: oh boy, i just love to sing!\n\nchandler: yes, i-i know that you do, but i think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing old man river.\n\njanice: oh, look at us! who would’ve thought that cupid had a station at 14th street nails. (does the laugh)\n\nchandler: (laughs) okay, we have to talk. i’m just getting out of a very serious relationship…\n\njanice: i know! and i’m just getting out of a marriage, i mean talk about meant to be!\n\nchandler: right! i just think that this is happening too soon.\n\njanice: oh, too soon, too schmoon. face it honey, i am not letting you get away this time.\n\nchandler: i hear ya.

(laughs) they’re gonna kill you!\n\nphoebe: well, why are you doing this anyway?\n\nross: well, you should’ve seen the guy that she used to go out with. i mean, he’s like joe rugby.\n\nphoebe: you’re kidding! and he plays rugby?! that’s so funny. (realises) ohh! i see how you did that. all right.\n\nross: anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. so i’m gonna show her how tough i really am!\n\nrachel: (starts laughing, ross stares at her) i’m sorry. i’m sorry. you’re right, you are a tough guy. you’re the toughest palaeontologist i know.\n\njoey: all right, come on look, ross can take care of himself! it’s not like he’s…chandler!\n\nchandler: (from his bedroom) thanks!\n\nross: look, don’t worry about me. okay? i’ll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. i’ll uh, i’ll be that guy right out of the circle.

(goes to say hi to the lads.)\n\n(a player comes over and picks up a ball in front of phoebe.)\n\nphoebe: (to the player) hi.\n\n(the player stands up and smiles. showing that he has no front teeth.)\n\nphoebe: whoa! (the player leaves and to joey) i kinda liked it.\n\n(the referee blows the whistle and the players gather to start the game.)\n\nross: okay, i know what i have to do. i’ve got to go red ross. (joey and phoebe don’t know what he’s talking about.) y’know, red ross!\n\njoey: i totally don’t know what you’re talking about.\n\nross: come on! the time we were all waiting in line for dances with wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and i just lost it?! screamed at him! turned all red! red ross!!\n\njoey: no.\n\nross: you’ll see.\n\n[cut to emily, devon, and liam]\n\nemily: liam, do me a favour. tell the lads to go easy on ross, it’s his first time.\n\nliam: you don’t say!

(ross gets pumped up.) ross! come on!\n\n(ross walks over to the scrum, walks around a bit looking for a way to get into the scrum.)\n\nliam: ross, come on! get in the bloody scrum! ross, get in!\n\n(ross, urged on by his team-mates, jumps on top of the scrum and falls headfirst into the middle, leaving his feet sticking straight up.)\n\nross: joey!!!!!!\n\n[scene, chandler and joey's erm, monica and rachel’s, monica is going over some plans as rachel enters.]\n\nrachel: you…are…not going to believe it! joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?\n\nmonica: he asked you out?!\n\nrachel: no. but i was showing him some cufflinks and i felt his pulse.\n\nmonica: saucy!\n\nrachel: (refers to the table) what are these?\n\nmonica: electrical plans for the building.\n\nrachel: okay, okay, okay should i be scared?\n\nmonica: i know that switch does something, okay? so-so i went down to city hall and got these. all i had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.\n\nrachel: wow! if only more people knew.\n\n[scene, the airport, the yemen express counter, chandler is still trying to get rid of janice.]\n\nchandler: y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.\n\njanice: oh please. every moment is precious. y’know? besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don’t really seem to care too much that you’re leaving.\n\nchandler: well, we’re really not that close. (pause) okay, so i guess this is uh, good-bye then.\n\njanice: on no! no! it’s not good-bye, i’m not leaving until you get on that plane.\n\nchandler: okay. then i guess it’s just, wait here then.
