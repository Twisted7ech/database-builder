(laughs)\n\nchandler: wait! you’re going out with kathy!\n\njoey: yeah. why are you getting so upset?\n\nchandler: well, i’m upset—for you. i mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (he can’t believe he just sad that.)\n\njoey: what is the big deal? it’s not like we’re exclusive.\n\nchandler: look, joey, kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. but casey, i mean granted i only saw the back of her head, but i got this sense that she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you.\n\njoey: you got all that from the back of her head?\n\nchandler: all right look, i think it’s time for you to settle down. y'know? make a choice, pick a lane.\n\njoey: who’s elaine?\n\n[scene, monica and rachel's, ross and monica are sitting on the couch playing cards, and phoebe is working on a new song.]\n\nphoebe: (singing) "little, tiny tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. swinging with the greatest of ease…" darn it! now, i don’t know who to get to the next verse.\n\nross: oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease… (plays air guitar) bah-bah-bha-bhannn." then go right into it.\n\nphoebe: yeah, ooh, i like that! yeah. wait! how do you know about ‘bah-bah-bha-bhan?’\n\nross: well umm, y’know, i used to play.\n\nphoebe: oh yeah, that’s right, the keyboards, huh?\n\nross: yeah, just a little in high school, but then i really got into it in college. i mean that’s-that’s when i really found my sound.\n\n(monica is taking a drink as ross says that, laughs, and snorts her drink.)\n\nmonica: oh god! orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. oh my god, i completely forgot about your sound.\n\nross: yeah.\n\nmonica: he used to lock himself in the basement for hours. no one was every allowed to hear, "the sound."\n\nphoebe: i wanna hear "the sound."\n\nross: really? no. i mean, nah, i haven’t played in so long, and-and, well it’s-it’s really personal stuff, y’know?\n\nphoebe: come on, play that funky music white boy.\n\nmonica: yeah!\n\nross: no, you guys, i mean my keyboards are all the way up in—no, yeah, okay.
