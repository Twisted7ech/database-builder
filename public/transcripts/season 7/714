(to rachel) what do you want to do today?\n\nrachel: nothing. i don’t want to do anything.\n\nmonica: well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like ross.\n\nross: hey! that was a practical purchase! i needed that car for transportation! okay? i-i have a child!\n\n[flashback to: a street, ross is sitting in his newly purchased mgb..]\n\nross: how hot do i look in this, huh?!\n\nchandler: ross, a sports car? wouldn’t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?\n\nross: that’s not what this is about okay? i-i am a sports car enthusiast. i have always been into cars.\n\njoey: hey, what’s the horsepower on this thing?\n\nross: (giddy) i don’t know, but-but look how shiny!\n\nmonica: i can’t believe you bought this.\n\nrachel: really! god ross, what were you thinking?

(phoebe hops in.) get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.\n\n(he starts the car and surprisingly in fires right up and comes to a nice idle. (both can be rarities with british sports cars with their lovely lucas ignition systems, which tend not to work especially in the rain.) anyway, this being new york he is parallel parked on a street with the car in front of him only inches ahead of his bumper, likewise with the car behind him. he’s completely boxed in and can’t move more than two inches. he tries to get out several times by bumping the bumpers of both cars to no avail.)\n\nross: damnit!

(to mr. geller) and you! i can’t believe that you would have a tux that’s thirty years old! (puts his hand on mr. geller’s shoulder.)\n\nmr. geller: it’s older than that. ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.\n\nchandler: ohh!

(rachel turns off the lights and everyone crouches. as everyone crouches, a ripping noise erupts from the assemblage.)\n\nmr. geller: crap.\n\n(we hear some fumbling at the door, then silence.)\n\nchandler: (getting up to investigate) okay, everybody stay here. i will find out what’s going on.\n\n(he goes out into the hall and finds a very drunk monica lying up against joey and rachel’s door.)\n\nmonica: heyyy!! you got the door open!! (giggles.)\n\nchandler: hey-hey are you drunk?\n\nmonica: nooo! (giggles) okay. (she tries to pull herself up by rachel and joey’s doorknob, but the door opens and she almost falls into the their apartment. she manages to catch herself.) whoa! (stands up, unsteadily) okay. see i was, i was a little nervous about turning (whispering) thirty. (giggles.) so the bus boys took me out for some drinks.

(the woman walks away.)\n\njoey: dude, you soooo need this car.\n\nphoebe: (running up) okay. okay, here’s what we’re gonna do. okay, i’m gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. you guys push it forward so ross can drive out of his spot. okay? all right, here we go. (she opens her coat and reveals that thing car thieves use to break into cars as ross jumps in behind the wheel. she inserts the device, unlocks the door, opens it, and the alarm goes off.) haul ass!!!! (runs off.)\n\n(the rest of the gang runs away, except for ross who’s tramped inside his car. to hide he puts the top up as monica, rachel, and joey come running past.)\n\n[scene, phoebe’s birthday, she’s taking the hippity-hop to ursula’s apartment as a gift. she knocks on the door and ursula answers it.]\n\nphoebe: happy thirtieth birthday! here!

(starts for monica’s room, but chandler stops him.)\n\n[scene, rachel’s birthday, everyone is presenting their presents to rachel.]\n\ntag: (handing his to her) this one’s from me.\n\nrachel: ahh!\n\ntag: it wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun.\n\nrachel: (opening it) a scooter!

(kisses him.)\n\nchandler: okay, open ours next. open ours next!\n\nrachel: okay.\n\njoey: now that you’re a couple, we don’t get two presents from you guys?\n\nchandler: for my last birthday you gave me a hug! (to rachel) okay, read the card! read the card!\n\nrachel: okay. (opens the card and reads it.) happy birthday grandma! it’s better to be over the hill (starting to cry) then buried under it. (breaks down as everyone glares at them.) all our love monica and chandler. (crying) that’s funny, yeah!\n\nchandler: no-no-no-no! that was the joke!\n\nrachel: (crying) no, i know! i get it! it’s funny!\n\nchandler: no, because you’re not a grandmother!\n\nrachel: no i know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and i don’t have any of those things. that’s why it’s so funny. i'm just going to go...(runs into her room crying.)\n\nmonica: all you had to do was buy the card!\n\ncommercial break\n\n[scene, rachel’s birthday, a time lapse has occurred. rachel is coming back into the living room carrying a notepad.]\n\nross: hey! look who’s back! it’s the birthday girl! how’s the birthday girl feeling?\n\nrachel: well, i feel fine, but i think you’re bumming out the rest of the kids.\n\nross: what? (glances over and sees the faces of the rest of the group, then goes and sits down.)\n\nrachel: okay! y’know what? i realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. all i really needed was a plan. see i wanna have three kids…\n\nphoebe: oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.\n\nrachel: as i was saying… i should probably have the first of the three kids by the time i’m 35 which gives me five years.\n\nross: (thinking it's a good idea) oh!\n\nrachel: i love this plan! i wanna marry this plan!\n\nphoebe: if you could do that, i’d marry the hippity-hop.\n\nrachel: so, if i wanna have my kid when i’m 35, i don’t have to get pregnant until i’m 34. which gives prada four years to start making maternity clothes! oh wait, but i do want to be married for a year before i get pregnant…\n\nmonica: really! that long?! (chandler slowly turns and looks at her.) (to chandler) look all you want, it’s happening!\n\nrachel: no, so i don’t have to get married until i’m 33! that’s three years, that’s three whole years—oh, wait a minute though. i’ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and i’d like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged… which means i need to meet the guy by the time i’m thirty.\n\nross: which is fine! because you just turned—(removes two candles from the cake)—twenty-eight!\n\nrachel: no! ross, no! it is not fine! eh-eh-according to my plan i should already be with the guy i wanna marry!\n\n(we hear tag scream out in the hallway and jump into view of the open door on the scooter. he gives a hearty thumbs up to the group and rides off, with joey following breathlessly behind.)\n\njoey: will you quit hoggin’ it!\n\ncommercial break\n\n[scene, monica’s birthday, monica is now dressed and is being helped out by chandler and rachel.]\n\nrachel: (to chandler) i’m telling you it’s like watching bambi learn how to walk.\n\nross: (to monica) you’re drunk! mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! maybe i’m a little drunk.\n\n(monica sits down on the barca lounger.)\n\nchandler: (to a waiter) oh that’s great! right there! can we get some of that over here please? (the waiter comes over) there we go.\n\njoey: (to the waiter) hey! are those crab cakes? (the waiter nods) did i not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?\n\nchandler: (to monica) how are you feeling?\n\nmonica: you are so handsome! i wanna make love to you right here, right now! (growls and pulls him into a kiss.)\n\nross: i really wish that you wouldn’t. (laughs and leans to a girl on the couch.)\n\nchandler: (to monica) now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? then we can put you in bed, okay? just smile and don’t talk to anyone.\n\nphoebe: (clinking two glasses together) speech! speech! let’s hear from the birthday girl! huh?\n\nchandler: pheebs!!\n\nphoebe: don’t you see? everyone’s looking at me! the plan’s working! i didn’t even have to take off my top yet!\n\nmrs. geller: speech! come on monica!\n\nross: come on!\n\nall: come on! speech!\n\n(monica stands up and wobbles slightly and chandler runs over to catch her.)\n\nmr. geller: (filming this) hey chandler, you can’t keep your hands off her for one second!\n\nmrs. geller: oh-ho, i think it’s nice.\n\nchandler: i think it’s necessary. (backs away anyhow.)\n\nmonica: i-i-i wanna thank you all for coming. my family and my friends…\n\nphoebe: (screaming) wooo!! hoo!!\n\nmonica: i really like to say that i’m-um… (pause) y’know what i’d really like to say? i’m drunk!! (mrs. geller pulls the camera down.) that’s right mom and dad your little harmonica is hammered!! (ross grabs the camera out of his dad’s hands.) and guess what! i’ve been drunk before! and i’ve smoked a cigarette! and i got a box of ding-dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! but you know what, you know what? it’s all okay. it’s okay because i turned thirty today. and, and i can do anything i want! because i am a grown up. (falls over sideways with ross filming the fall.)\n\nphoebe: (to joey) okay quick, help me get this off! (motions to her top.)\n\njoey: yeah!!\n\n(ross pans the camera over to phoebe.)\n\n[scene, phoebe’s birthday, she’s telling everyone what she found out at ursula’s while sitting in central perk.]\n\nphoebe: i lost a whole year! i can’t believe it! this is so unfair!\n\njoey: oh, i don’t know pheebs. it’ll be okay.\n\nphoebe: will it? will it?! i mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?\n\njoey: that’s not gonna happen. no.
