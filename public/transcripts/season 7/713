(joey sets his beer and bag of chips down and heads into his room.) oh what does he know! come on rosita, us chichas got to stick together!

(monica and ross are shocked.)\n\nross: what?\n\nphoebe: oh yeah, like you never called!\n\n[scene, the telemarketing office, phoebe is getting shown to her desk by the supervisor.]\n\nsupervisor: so basically this is very easy. you read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.\n\nphoebe: okay, i can do that! oh, by the way, i love my office.\n\nsupervisor: (laughs) why don’t we do a trial run.\n\nphoebe: oh okay. umm, all right.

(hangs up the phone.) yeah you’re right, this is easy.\n\nsupervisor: okay, what was wrong with that call?\n\nphoebe: oh well, all right…um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.\n\nsupervisor: they’re always going to tell you they don’t need toner, but that’s okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.\n\nphoebe: oh.\n\nsupervisor: so, i think you’re ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?\n\nphoebe: no. (pause) oh wait yes! i do, i do have one question. what is toner?\n\n[scene, joey and rachel's, chandler is entering.]\n\nchandler: joey! joe!

(she goes to the attic.)\n\nmr. geller: so, i think you’re boxes are over here. (they walk over to them.)\n\nross: wow! great! (finds a pack of cigarettes.) wait, dad who-who’s cigarettes are these?\n\nmr. geller: i don’t know. they-they must be your mother’s, but please, please don’t ask her. i’ll throw these away.

(he goes to remove the back, but it doesn’t come off. so he sits down in it, puts his feet up, stands up, and looks back at it.) she’s healed!\n\nrachel: that’s weird.\n\njoey: no it’s not weird, it’s a miracle!\n\nrachel: it’s not a miracle joey! i’m sure there’s some explanation.\n\njoey: oh there is! if you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!\n\nrachel: joey, i really don’t…\n\njoey: (interrupting her) can you tell me how this happened?\n\nrachel: well no.\n\njoey: miracle!\n\nrachel: no, y’know what? maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! or something!\n\njoey: someone like an…angel?\n\nrachel: that’s right joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair. (she sits down in the chair.)\n\njoey: (angrily) get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
