(pointing to an attractive man sitting at a table behind them.)\n\nrachel: oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.\n\nphoebe: (a woman with large breasts walks in the door) ohh knockers will help us figure it out.

(the man gets up and leaves.)\n\nphoebe: ohh, he left his cell phone.\n\nrachel: oh, well, we can hand it to gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.\n\nphoebe: or we could use it to call china. see how those guys are doing.\n\nrachel: what if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and i answer and we start talking and we fell in love. i mean wouldn't that be a great story? kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.\n\nphoebe: yeah… that does sound great. i'm going to get the phone. (they both get up.)\n\nrachel: what? wait! why…why do you get the story?\n\nphoebe: i don't know. i haven't been out on a date in so long.\n\nrachel: phoebe, you had a date three days ago.\n\nphoebe: that wasn’t a date! that was, that was just friends getting together…(quietly) having sex.\n\nrachel: okay. okay, see? i get the phone.\n\nphoebe: no way! no way! you just broke with tag a week ago.\n\nrachel: yeah!

(she throws her drink in his face.)\n\njoey: ms. monroe… (she slaps him) oh there you go.

(she walks away.)\n\ncecilia: (walking up) you’re absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. they don’t know exactly when it’s going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that’s it.\n\njoey: i’m so sorry. look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.\n\ncecilia: yeah, thanks.\n\njoey: no i mean it! i can’t believe they would do this to you! and to your fans! i mean they are going to be devastated! heart broken! they love you so much!\n\ncecilia: oh you’re right. thank you! what’s your name again?\n\njoey: joey.\n\ncecilia: joey, well thank you. that is so sweet. oh, excuse me.

(to joey) you were saying?\n\njoey: uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye—l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that i, that i came up to you before was because well, i’m really nervous about-about being you. y’know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. y’know? help me keep jessica alive. please?\n\ncecilia: all right joey, i will help you. not because i-i owe it to this stupid show, but because i owe it to jessica.\n\njoey: oh that’s great! oh thank you so much!\n\ncecilia: you’re so welcome.\n\njoey: hey! now, i’ve been watching some tapes, how’s this? (in a british accent.) "jessica lockhart will never step foot in this place again! ever!!"\n\ncecilia: is that supposed to be me?\n\njoey: yeah.\n\ncecilia: yeah but jessica doesn’t have an english accent.\n\njoey: (shocked) i can do an english accent?! that baby’s going on my resume!\n\nin the edited version, scene 8 and scene 9 are switched around, with a commercial break after scene 9.\n\n*[scene 8: central perk, monica and chandler are sitting on the couch. ross is sitting on the armchair.]*\n\nchandler: well, i feel like a snack!\n\nmonica: do you want some shortbread? eh that’s scottish like you are.\n\nchandler: oh no thanks. i don’t like any thing from my scottish heritage.\n\nross: what?!\n\nchandler: well it’s just my entire family was run out of scotland by…vikings. anyway, lots of bad memories. (makes a few unintelligible noises.)\n\nross: oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its scottish roots.\n\nmonica: no! no-no they’re not. they’re still very angry! but y’know chandler is also half-swedish. you know what the swedish people are famous for? sitting down and being quiet.\n\nross: well yeah-yeah the scottish history is so much more…\n\nmonica: (interrupting) you can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!\n\nross: how did you know about that?!\n\nchandler: we heard you play all the way from your apartment!\n\nross: were you the ones called the cops?!\n\nchandler: that’s not really important right now. what is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.\n\nross: why not?\n\nchandler: because we hate them.\n\nross: come on that’s not fair! i mean you haven’t even heard me play!\n\nchandler: we have heard you play.\n\nross: no, you’ve heard my practice. okay? just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. and i’m not going to tell you what song i’m gonna play either. but uh, let’s just say when it’s over i’ll bet there will be a we bit o’ celebration.\n\n*[scene 9: silvercup studios, joey is getting pointers on how to play jessica lockhart.]*\n\ncecilia: so, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. so, when jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. (joey is nodding.) you try.\n\njoey: okay! (he scurries out the set door and re-enters, extremely impressed) all right!\n\ncecilia: no, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! he’s not finding it out for the first time! so, try it again.\n\njoey: okay. okay.

(joey gets a snooty look on his face.) all right, it’s a little weird, but it’s getting better. (joey is pleased.) oh well, i’m gonna miss this woman so much. i don’t know what i’m going to do! i mean, it’s been 20 years of my life.\n\njoey: oh well—hey-hey! maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. y’know? it’ll-it’ll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. you’re so talented.\n\ncecilia: i am. i am, but i don’t know you know. an actor of a certain age is not that easy.\n\njoey: hey that’s not true! look at uh, look at angela lansb—angelina jolie!\n\ncecilia: i probably should’ve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y’know i just got so comfy here! and… ohh, i turned down some amazing work!\n\njoey: like-like what?\n\ncecilia: well, let’s just say if i left 15 years ago, the landscape of mexican cinema would be very different today!\n\njoey: (impressed) wow!\n\ncecilia: but… well now, now’s a different time for me. (starts to cry.)\n\njoey: oh hey come on, don’t-don’t-don’t do this! umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? now when i watch you do a scene, i’m thinking, "boy, she-she is a great actress!" (she’s not buying it.) uh but-but, i am also thinking, "she is hot!"\n\ncecilia: (intrigued) you think i’m hot?\n\njoey: you own the room.

(she does so.)\n\njoey: yeah-yeah, i noticed that! is that ‘cause she’s so passionate?\n\ncecilia: no! it’s because that way the camera only sees her! (she takes her hands off his face.) do you wanna try it?\n\njoey: yeah! okay. (he puts his hands on her face and they kiss.)\n\ncecilia: that was good, that was really good. but i-i think your hands maybe a little off, they should be maybe right like… (she grabs the back of his neck and kisses him passionately causing them to fall onto the couch.)\n\ncommercial break\n\n[scene 8 follows]\n\n[scene 10: phoebe's apartment, phoebe and rachel are waiting for the cute guy to show up for his cell phone. rachel is putting on perfume by spraying it ahead of her face, and moving into it. phoebe tries to steal some.]\n\nrachel: hey! hey!\n\n(there is a knock on the door.)\n\nphoebe and rachel: (simultaneously) who is it?\n\nguy: hi! it’s tom, i’m here to pick up the phone.\n\n(rachel excitedly jumps up and heads for the door.)\n\nphoebe: whoa! why do you get to answer the door?\n\nrachel: well why shouldn’t i?!\n\nphoebe: because it’s my apartment!\n\nrachel: well, then i get to give him the cell phone.\n\nphoebe: okay. all right.
