(starts to leave.)\n\nthe casting director: wait joey! you didn’t need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.\n\njoey: and scene! huh? wasn’t that fun? we did a little improv there. yeah! okay! so you-you-you-you were saying?\n\nthe casting director: well, the director thinks you’re really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.\n\njoey: wow! sure! that’s great!\n\nthe casting director: oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.\n\njoey: yeah! yeah sure, just long as it’s handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.\n\nthe casting director: terrific! well uh, there’s one more thing. uhh, uh it’s really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. yeah and so in your love scene with sarah she talks about how she’s never seen a naked man who wasn’t jewish. so… (laughs.)\n\njoey: so…what?\n\nthe casting director: so uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not jewish. do you know what i’m saying?\n\njoey: yes!\n\nthe casting director: okay.\n\njoey: no. what?\n\nthe casting director: an italian catholic immigrant at this time would not be…\n\njoey: bar mitzvahed?\n\n(the casting director shakes her head.)\n\nthe casting director: think 13 years earlier....lose the rabbi and add a scalpel.\n\n(joey thinks about it and finally realizes what she means.)\n\n[scene, monica and chandler's, joey is telling monica what the casting director was trying to get too.]\n\nmonica: so to get this part you can’t be?\n\njoey: nope.\n\nmonica: but you are?\n\njoey: yep.\n\nmonica: but you told them you weren’t?\n\njoey: that’s right.\n\nmonica: wow! wow! and it’s definitely all gone? there’s nothing there to work with? (joey glares at her.) what were you thinking?\n\njoey: i don’t know! i really want this part! and they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell ‘em you can! and just figure out how to do it later.\n\nmonica: joey! this is not like learning to ride a horse! this is like learning to…grow a turtleneck!\n\njoey: i kn-i know! i know! okay? and apparently tomorrow when i go in to meet the director i have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.\n\nmonica: oh my god, what are you gonna do?!\n\njoey: i just have to call my agent and tell her i can’t do the part. (gets up for the phone.)\n\nmonica: unless!\n\njoey: unless what?\n\nmonica: well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.\n\njoey: like what?\n\nmonica: well i’m not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head i’m thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.\n\n[scene, joey and rachel's, phoebe is entering and rachel is still planning.]\n\nphoebe: hey! i’ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower. okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone’s names in them and inside is everyone’s individual birth stone.\n\nrachel: okay. okay. all right, you take care of that. and meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don’t have a guest list.\n\nphoebe: okay. okay! well okay, who do we know that’s coming? me. are you?\n\nmonica: (entering) hey!\n\nphoebe: hey!\n\nrachel: hey! what’s up mon?\n\nmonica: well uh, i’m trying to make something for joey. do you mind if i raid your fridge?\n\nrachel: have at it.\n\nmonica: okay.

(picks it up) i hope that won’t work.\n\nrachel: are you makin’ him a sandwich?\n\nmonica: no it’s umm, more like a wrap. okay so uh, i’m gonna go guys.\n\nphoebe and rachel: okay.\n\nmonica: i guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present! (runs out.)\n\nrachel: (to phoebe, after monica’s gone) we have to get her a present?!\n\nphoebe: okay but look! look at what i got! it’s her address book! (holds it up.) we have a guest list!\n\nrachel: oh my god you’re amazing! did you just pull that out of her purse?\n\nphoebe: uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.

(she laughs) we’re probably too old to do that now.\n\ncassie: i’ll always remember that summer, because it’s when i got all of these freckles. (she pulls her blouse open to show him her shoulder and bra strap.)\n\nross: (looking then moving away quickly) uh-huh! uh-huh! and-and-and i’ll always remember that summer because that’s when i realized that we are related. y'know. we're not just two random people thrown together. we share genetic material.\n\ncassie: it took you that long to figure it out, huh?\n\nross: well i’m, i’m a little slow. (to himself) just as our children would be.\n\n[scene, phoebe's apartment, it’s monica’s bridal shower and phoebe is passing out some finger food.]\n\nphoebe: hi!\n\nwoman: hi!\n\nphoebe: how are you?

(to a different group) over here we have pink suede, which is nice. but umm, if it gets wet then you know it’s gonna shrink.\n\njoey: well maybe we just take that one away. (picks it up and throws it away.)\n\nmonica: i also, did a little something in fur. but umm, that’s really just for me. (rubs it against her cheek.) okay. so, why don’t you go into your room and try these on and we’ll see—get a better idea of what’s gonna work.\n\njoey: thanks, you are such a good friend. and this is so weird.\n\njoey: okay, the taffy's too sticky.\n\nmonica: i was afraid of that.\n\n(he goes into his room to try them on and closes the door.)\n\njoey: ow!\n\nmonica: toothpick?\n\njoey: yeah.\n\nmonica: what are you trying on now?\n\njoey: the fruit roll up.\n\nmonica: and?\n\njoey: delicious.\n\nmonica: joey!\n\njoey: wait a minute! wait a minute! we have a winner!\n\nmonica: what?! which one?!\n\njoey: the silly putty! it’s not so silly anymore!\n\n(they hug.)\n\n[scene, ross's apartment, cassie and ross are watching a movie and cassie is pouring ross some more wine as ross has his hands full with the glass and holding the bowl of popcorn in his lap.]\n\nross: (in his head) she’s your cousin. she’s your cousin! if she knew what was going on in your head she’d think you were sick! (she grabs some popcorn.) or would she? let’s back up a second. she was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. she was the one who turned down the lights. she was the one that wanted to rent logan’s run, the sexiest movie ever. (she grabs the blanket from behind him and looks at him.) oh, i know that look. forget it. i want it. she wants it. i’m going in.\n\n(they exchange looks, smile, and shrug their shoulders before ross suddenly lunges forward in an attempt to kiss her, but she expertly backs away.)\n\ncassie: hey! what the hell are you doing?! (they sit back up.)\n\nross: (in his head) say something clever! (pause.) okay, doesn’t have to be clever, it just has to be words. say some words. (pause) any words will do.
