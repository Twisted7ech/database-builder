(flashback to chandler about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. i walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. (the flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way around the steam filled room. he takes off his glasses.) so i take off my glasses and that’s when in happened.\n\n[cut to the flashback, chandler’s no longer doing the voice-over.]\n\nchandler: guys?\n\nross: over here. (you can see ross sitting at the far wall.)\n\nmr. geller: have a seat son. (you can see mr. geller sitting closer to the door as chandler walks over and sits in his lap.) hey!!

(exits.)\n\nross: (to rachel) hey are you getting monica and chandler an engagement present?\n\nrachel: i don’t know. y’know, they didn’t get us anything.\n\nross: thank you!\n\njoey: (entering) hey.\n\nross: hey.\n\nrachel: well hello! so, when are we gettin’ back out on the water matey?\n\njoey: oh uh, i don’t know the boat way to say this, but uh never!\n\nrachel: why not?\n\njoey: because! you’re mean on the boat!\n\nrachel: what? i was just trying to teach you.\n\njoey: well, lesson learned! rachel is mean!\n\nross: yeeeeeep… yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. i remember when she took out on her dad’s boat she wouldn’t let me help at all.\n\nrachel: excuse me, i wanted you to help, but you couldn’t move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.\n\nross: you have to respect the sea! (storms off.)\n\nrachel: look joey, i’m sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but i gotta tell ya something. that was not mean. okay, my father is mean. he used to yell at me all the time on the boat, i mean it was horrible. i was just being a good teacher.\n\njoey: does a good teacher say, "put down the beer pinhead!?"\n\nrachel: well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?\n\njoey: six and a half! you knocked that last one out of my hand! remember?\n\nrachel: yeah, i didn’t want you to get hit by the boom!\n\njoey: well it hit me anyway! and it would’ve hurt a lot less if i had finished that last beer.\n\nrachel: all right, y’know what? i-i’m sorry. i will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.\n\njoey: you won’t boss me around anymore?\n\nrachel: i won’t boss you around.\n\njoey: and you’ll be nice?\n\nrachel: and, i’ll be nice.\n\njoey: and you’ll be topless?\n\nrachel: and—joey!\n\njoey: do you want me to learn?!\n\n[scene, monica, chandler, and phoebe's, monica is trying out different cookie recipes. ross and phoebe are the tasting group.]\n\nmonica: okay, here’s batch 22. ohh, maybe these’ll taste a little like your grandmother’s. this has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.\n\nross: let’s give it a shot.\n\nmonica: okay. man, i have not made this many cookies since i was in the ninth grade.\n\nphoebe: oh, what was that for? like a bake sale?\n\nmonica: no, just a friday night.\n\n(they all take a bite.)\n\nross: ohh, these are pretty good.\n\nphoebe: yeah, but not as good as batch 17.\n\nross: which one was that?\n\nmonica: the ones we had right after you almost threw up.\n\nross: oh yeah! batch 17 was good. i did not like batch 16. (burps a little bit.) i’m okay.\n\nphoebe: are there anymore from the good batch? ‘cause we could just work off of those.\n\nross: yeah, ooh yeah, i think there is one from batch 17 left, uh… (grabs a cookie and takes a big bite out of it and doesn’t like it.) it’s batch 16! 16 people! get out of the way! (gets up and runs for the bathroom.)\n\n[scene, the mr. bowmont, its joey’s second lesson with rachel as the resident sailing expert.]\n\nrachel: okay joey honey, you’re doing really good! all right, now i’m just gonna need you to step to the port side. (joey pauses as he tries to remember which side is the port side.) remember? remember how we talked about the port side?\n\njoey: ohh yeah.\n\nrachel: right?\n\njoey: nope.\n\nrachel: it’s left sweetie, but that’s okay sweetie, that’s a tough one.\n\njoey: i don’t know why you just don’t say left.\n\nrachel: okay, go to the left.

(grabs and opens one.)\n\nrachel: okay joey, we’re luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham? (the mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped working efficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)\n\njoey: uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff i didn’t know there.\n\nrachel: joey, come on! we just went over this! (she does it instead.)\n\njoey: oh, y’know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. did you see it? it was gross!\n\nrachel: (angrily) no! all right?! i did not see the bird! i did not see the fish! i did not see the piece of styrofoam that was shaped like mike tyson! i did not, because i was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! which obviously is an impossible thing to do!\n\njoey: all right that’s it! you’re yelling and i don’t see you taking your top off! i quit!\n\nrachel: what do you mean you quit?! you can’t quit!\n\njoey: why not?!\n\nrachel: because you’re not finished yet and i won’t have it! greens do not quit!\n\njoey: greens? i’m a tribbiani! and tribbianis quit!\n\nrachel: oh my god, wait did i—i just said greens don’t quit didn’t i?

(thinks) joey!\n\nphoebe: y’know, i bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. i bet she’s l-l-lookin’ up at us and smiling right now.\n\nross: looking up?\n\nphoebe: oh yeah—no, she was really nice to me, but she’s in hell for sure.\n\nmonica: well, i’ve tried everything. i give up. i guess i’m not gonna be the mom who makes the world’s best chocolate cookies. i do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  kids love that right.\n\nross: aww, pheeb, come on isn’t there any relative that would have the recipe? what about, what about your sister?\n\nphoebe: oh no-no, no, i made a promise to myself that the next time i would talk to ursula would be over my dead body. and that’s not happening ‘til october 15th, 2032.\n\nross: that’s the day you’re gonna die? see—darnit, i’ve got shuffleboard that day.\n\nphoebe: that’s what you think.\n\nmonica: well, i mean what about friends of your grandmother’s? wouldn’t they have the recipe?\n\nphoebe: well, y’know i may have relatives in france who would know. my grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, nesele tolouse.\n\nmonica: what was her name?\n\nphoebe: nesele toulouse.\n\nmonica: nestle tollhouse?!\n\nphoebe: oh, you americans always butcher the french language.\n\nmonica: (grabbing a bag of nestle tollhouse chocolate chips) phoebe, is this the recipe? (tosses her the bag.)\n\nphoebe: (reading the recipe on the back of the bag) yes!! (realizes.) ohh.\n\nmonica: i cannot believe that i just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!\n\nphoebe: i know! you see it is stuff like this which is why (looking down) you’re burning in hell!!\n\n[scene, the gym, chandler and mr. geller are heading for the whirlpool room.]\n\nchandler: so you understand, i’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didn’t tell people what happened. y’know, i’m a little…i’m a little embarrassed about it.\n\nmr. geller: i understand completely, there’s nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. as a matter of fact, when i started dating judy i was unemployed, and her father asked me what i did for a living and i told him i was a lawyer.\n\nchandler: what did you do when they found out?\n\nmr. geller: they never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. shall we?\n\n(chandler nods along and they enter the whirlpool room and remove their robes. only chandler is lacking a certain item of clothing. you see this is a coed whirlpool, which means swimsuits, and in fact there are two women already there and chandler didn’t seem to wear his. needless to say, everyone is shocked, including chandler.)\n\nchandler: so i guess we wear swimsuits in here!\n\nending credits\n\n[scene, the mr. bowmont, is tied up alongside the pier; joey and rachel are relaxing.]\n\nrachel: well joey, i hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.\n\njoey: yeah, yeah. hey, why don’t you give a pull on that rope?
