(rachel glares at her.) i've blown both of your secrets. now we're even.\n\nmonica: great! well rachel, the reason why i won’t let you drive the porsche is because you’re a terrible driver. there! that wasn’t about the wedding.\n\nross: look rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the porsche i’ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.\n\njoey: yeah, you got a couple hours?\n\nopening credits\n\n[scene, central perk, rachel is there as ross enters with his all his hair sticking straight up.]\n\nross: whew! that was a brisk ride!\n\nrachel: take the top down did ya?\n\nross: only way to fly.\n\n(rachel laughs.)\n\nrachel: come on ross give me the keys! monica does not know what she’s talking about! i am an excellent driver!\n\nross: you’re fast and irresponsible. that adds up to a bad driver.\n\nrachel: well in high school, that added up to head cheerleader.\n\n(a woman walks by and smiles at ross’s hair.)\n\nross: did you see the look that girl just gave me? huh? she must’ve seen me cruising in the bad boy.\n\nrachel: i think she’s checking out your beehive ross.\n\nross: what?! (checks his hair.) give-give me a brush.\n\nrachel: gimme the keys!\n\nross: no way!\n\nrachel: well no brush!\n\nross: fine! y’know what? it doesn’t matter, because, if i remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.\n\n(he goes to the bathroom and after he leaves rachel goes through his coat and grabs the keys along with a $20 bill. the woman from before watches her do this.)\n\nrachel: (to the woman) alimony. (runs outside.)\n\n[scene, monica and chandler's, monica and phoebe are counting the invitations as chandler exits from the bathroom.]\n\nmonica: chandler, we still haven’t gotten an rsvp from your dad.\n\nchandler: oh! right. umm, maybe that’s because i didn’t send him an invitation.\n\nmonica: why not?\n\nchandler: an invitation? that's like almost asking him to come.\n\nmonica: chandler! he’s your father; he should be at the wedding.\n\nchandler: i was gonna send him an invitation. i looked at the stamp...it was one of those marilyn monroe stamps and thought "my dad has that dress."\n\nphoebe: wow. that must be a very different view when he stands over an air vent.\n\nchandler: you should see him sing "happy birthday, mr. president."\n\nmonica: we have to invite him.\n\nchandler: i don’t even know the man. okay? we’re not the close. i haven’t seen him in years.\n\nmonica: well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!\n\nchandler: well he doesn’t have to know! it’s not like we run in the same circles. i hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in vegas.\n\nphoebe: ooh, i think i wanna trade circles.\n\nchandler: trust me, you don’t want him there either. okay? nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.\n\nmonica: so what! as long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil i don’t care.\n\nphoebe: okay, i think i need to do some shopping.

(she turns on the wipers forcing ross off of the hood.)\n\nross: there is no way i am letting you drive this car! so why don’t you just hand over the keys?\n\nrachel: oh.\n\n{transcriber’s note: she puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side of the steering wheel. does anyone know why that is? it’s a tradition left over from porsche’s racing history. the world’s greatest endurance race is the 24 hours of lemans. which is in france and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on sunday.  in the 60s lemans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. at the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts, put the car in gear and start it. the driver’s left hand did nothing. porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. that’s why every porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.}\n\nross: no ah-ah-ah! do not start this car! (she starts the car.) okay! okay! i will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! (he looks for the twenty rachel stole and doesn’t find it.)\n\nrachel: look ross, if you’re so freaked out, just get in the car!\n\nross: with you?! yeah right!\n\nrachel: all right. (she starts off.)\n\nross: (grabbing the car) okay! okay! okay! (he gets in, but into the back seat.)\n\nrachel: what are you doing?! get in the front!\n\nross: in the death seat?!!\n\nrachel: oh my…\n\n(they drive off.)\n\n[scene, central perk, joey and phoebe are on the couch as a man enters.]\n\nman: hey guys!\n\njoey: hey!\n\nphoebe: hey sweetie!\n\nman: ready to go?\n\nphoebe: yeah! sure! ooh, i left my purse up at monica’s. i’ll be right back.
