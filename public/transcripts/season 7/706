(chandler laughs)\n\n(as monica enters, chandler quickly changes the channel to a cooking show)\n\nchef on tv: now, we mince the shallot like this...\n\nchandler: (to monica) look honey, the nice people are chopping shallots.\n\nmonica: if they chop enough of them maybe they can open up that bikini shop!yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey i was at brunch. this woman overheard that i was marrying you and-and then she…she wished me good luck.\n\nchandler: that's sweet.\n\nmonica: no, it's more like a (sarcastically) good luck.\n\nchandler: well do you think she meant good luck taming the wild stallion?\n\nmonica: not judging you...a little gay!\n\nchandler: so uh, what did this woman look like?\n\nmonica: she was like 30, dark hair, attractive.\n\nchandler: well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?\n\nmonica: come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?\n\nchandler: no, no i only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive… (thinks a little while.) hold on one second; let me check this out.

(pointing to the picture.)\n\nmonica: oh my god yes! who is she?\n\nchandler: julie grath, my camp girlfriend.\n\nmonica: did you break up with her?\n\nchandler: (pause) no, we're still together. yeah we went out for two summers, and then i broke up with her.\n\nmonica: why?\n\nchandler: well, ‘cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow…\n\nmonica: fat?!\n\nchandler: i did not say fat! i said, "fa-aa-aw-ow…"\n\nmonica: you broke up with a girl because she was fat?!\n\nchandler: yeah. yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! does she still feel bad?\n\nmonica: well, apparently she does.\n\nchandler: well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (monica is not amused by that statement.) seriously, good luck marrying me.\n\n[scene, joey and rachel's.]\n\nphoebe (enters): hey rach, you want to come with me friday night? i'm gonna check out some strippers.\n\nrachel: for the bachelorette party?\n\nphoebe: (pauses) yes.\n\n(joey enters)\n\njoey: hey! what's going on?\n\nrachel: phoebe is gonna be monica's maid of honor!\n\njoey: hey! well i hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?

(ross enters.) (in a sexy voice.) hiiiii, ross! sweetie.\n\nphoebe: hey there, you handsome thing.

(knocks on the door.) chandler! i just figured out who you are!\n\nchandler: can you figure out what i'm doing?\n\nmonica: you're lewis posin.\n\nchandler: who?\n\nmonica: lewis posin! he was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day i asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. do you know why?\n\nchandler: because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!\n\nmonica: no! but because he thought i was to faaaaa…. (chandler emerges, without flushing by the way.) and every time i think about it, it makes me feel as bad as i did in fifth grade! y'know, i-i really think that you should apologize to julie.\n\nchandler: what? are you kidding? that was like 16 years ago.\n\nmonica: no, i know. but y'know what? it would make me feel better if lewis apologized to me.\n\nchandler: okay, i will do it. but i have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!\n\nmonica: i can live with that.\n\nchandler: okay so how do we find her?\n\nmonica: she probably lives in the city. she was eating in that restaurant.\n\nchandler: i'll bet she was!!! (laughs then monica just looks at him and he suddenly stops laughing) what is wrong with me?\n\n[scene, joey and rachel's, joey and ross are laying out the ground rules for the maid of honor auditions to rachel and phoebe.]\n\njoey: okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. we're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.\n\nross: no, 10 is the highest.\n\njoey: why is 10 the highest?\n\nross: because it's the highest. (joey shrugs his shoulders) okay, rachel you're up first. (rachel stands up and gets ready.) situation no. 1: you're with monica, the wedding is about to start when monica gets cold feet. go!

(ross lays down on the floor) i'll be monica. go!\n\n(joey quickly lays next to ross but gets a little too comfortable and close for ross' taste.)\n\nross: oh no no no! this situation is not sanctioned! now we are moving into the next one. okay, it is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.\n\nrachel: ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre…\n\nross: go!\n\nrachel: okay! okay! umm, webster's dictionary defines marriage as… (ross and joey start writing.) okay!! forget that! that sucks!! okay, never mind! forget it! umm, umm, okay, uh… i met, i-i met, i met monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and i became friends with chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.\n\nross and joey: oh! that's nice.\n\nrachel: thank you. thank you very much. umm, i've known them separately and i've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. so i would like to raise my glass (grabs a glass and holds it up) to monica and chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. i can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.\n\njoey: wow. (to ross) good speech.\n\nross: yeah, it really was!\n\nrachel: aw, thanks!\n\nross: okay phoebe, i guess you're next (to joey) although i really don't see the point.\n\njoey: yeah.\n\nphoebe: okay, i can't believe that monica and chandler are getting married. i remember talking about this day with rachel while we were showering together, naked.

(pause as she nods no.) well, i guess my work here is done!\n\n[scene, central perk, phoebe and rachel are waiting for the results from joey and ross.]\n\nphoebe: (to ross and joey) can i get you guys a drink while you tabulate?\n\nross: no, actually the final vote has been tallied.\n\njoey: i'll take a cocoa.\n\nphoebe: oh too late!\n\njoey: all right, well first of all i would like to say that you both performed very well. okay? you should be proud of yourselves. and-and i would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. well, except for rachel—damnit!\n\nphoebe: really?! i won!\n\nrachel: what?!\n\nross: i'm sorry rach, it was, it was really close.\n\nrachel: well then i demand a recount! (hmm, i wonder where i've heard that before.)\n\nross: actually, it wasn't that close.\n\nrachel: no! y'know what? no! no! you thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous—we're gonna flip a coin! (phoebe gasps.) all right?! (she flips the coin.) heads! (looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)\n\nphoebe: the coins have finally forgiven me!\n\nrachel: well y'know what? i hope monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! (runs out.)\n\nphoebe: (running after her) rach, it's gonna be okay! (to ross and joey) you guys are the best!\n\njoey: boy i tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.\n\nross: yeah?\n\njoey: yeah! i was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. (raises his eyebrows, questioning ross to see if he wants to join him.)\n\nross: why-why would i care about that?\n\njoey: no reason, i'm just saying that uh… that's where i'll be.\n\n(joey gets up and heads for the door. after a pause ross decides to join him.)\n\n[scene, monica, chandler, and phoebe's, chandler and monica have returned from julie's.]\n\nchandler: as bad as that went i actually enjoyed myself. i think that i'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things i do.\n\nmonica: why don't you just stop doing stupid things? then you wouldn't have to apologize.\n\nchandler: i would really love it if could do both.\n\nmonica: all right, i…i have to ask.\n\nchandler: what?\n\nmonica: are you gonna break up with me if i get fat again?\n\nchandler: what?!\n\nmonica: well, you broke up with julie grath! how much weight could she have gained?\n\nchandler: a hundred and forty-five pounds.\n\nmonica: in one year?! my god what did she eat? her-her family! that's not the point.\n\nchandler: look i know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but i was 15!\n\nmonica: well… that's not the only time this was an issue. you remember when umm, you spent thanksgiving with us? you called me fat.\n\nchandler: okay. okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.\n\nmonica: how?\n\nchandler: you were not supposed to hear that! i said that behind you back!\n\nmonica: what if i have babies, okay? i mean i'm gonna look different. i'm okay with that, but i'm not sure that you are!\n\nchandler: look you have to realize i don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. (monica glares at him.) see this is one of things that i can apologize for later! look, what i mean is you're monica! okay? and i am in love with monica.\n\nmonica: keep going.\n\nchandler: so you can balloon up or you can shrink down and i will still love you.\n\nmonica: even if i shrink down to two inches tall?\n\nchandler: i'd carry you around in my pocket.\n\nmonica: i love you. (they hug and kiss.)\n\nchandler: skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.\n\n[scene, central perk, phoebe is there as rachel enters carrying a shopping bag.]\n\nrachel: hi pheebs.\n\nphoebe: hi!\n\nrachel: hi! i just want to apologize. i'm really sorry i was a baby.\n\nphoebe: that's ridiculous rachel, we were all babies once. (rachel looks at her.) oh, you mean today.\n\nrachel: yeah. yeah, and y'know you-you deserve to win. and-and y'know i was thinking about it, if-if you're monica's maid of honor that means i get to be yours.\n\nphoebe: oh yeah!\n\nrachel: yeah! oh, umm when-when monica and chandler got engaged i started putting some stuff together, y'know just in case…\n\nphoebe: oh that's so sweet thanks.\n\nrachel: here is a book of poetry that i know monica loves. and-and ohh god this is funny, look, this is a picture of one halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (shows phoebe the picture.) and look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because i was wonder woman. oh and here's a little purse that i found. (hands her the purse) y'know i just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.\n\nphoebe: ohh.\n\nrachel: and umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know ‘cause, people cry at weddings. (starting to cry.) i'm just gonna grab a couple of these.\n\nphoebe: this stuff is great!\n\nrachel: oh, i forgot this was in here. umm, this was the uh garter that i was saving for my wedding and i wanted it to be monica's something borrowed and it's blue. (starts to cry again.) yeah…\n\nphoebe: y'know rach, i think that, i think you should be monica's made of honor.\n\nrachel: you do? why?\n\nphoebe: because i think it means more to you.\n\nrachel: but pheebs, y'know you earned it.\n\nphoebe: its fine. i mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14? (she's referring to the halloween picture.)\n\nrachel: no, i was ten. i just developed early.\n\nphoebe: (looking at the picture again) man alive!\n\nmonica: (entering) hey, what's going on?\n\nrachel: hey!\n\nphoebe: well, we just decided that rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.\n\nmonica: (gasps) ohh, wow! that's great!

(runs out leaving rachel completely stunned and phoebe laughing.)\n\nrachel: yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's gonna be yours.
