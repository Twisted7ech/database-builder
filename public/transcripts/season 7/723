(starts to laugh a little, but no one else does) (a pause ensues) it was his dog! did i say it was his dog? anyway...and uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. and, she’s the greatest sister a guy could ask for. so if you’d all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we’re here to celebrate. (everyone does so.) to the bings.\n\nall: to the bings!\n\n(everyone clinks glasses and chandler freaks out again.)\n\n[scene, monica and chandler's, monica, phoebe, and rachel are in the kitchen.]\n\nphoebe: how cool is this?: the next time you are going to see chandler you're gonna be walking down the aisle.\n\nmonica: i can't believe that after tomorrow, it's all gonna be over.\n\nrachel: oh honey. it's not gonna be over; you're gonna be married to chandler.\n\nmonica: oh! maybe i can wear the dress for halloween!

(he hands her the note.)\n\nrachel: what?!\n\nross: he left that.\n\nrachel: (reading the note) tell monica i’m sorry.\n\nphoebe: (walking up) what’s up? (rachel hands her the note and she reads it.) tell monica i’m sorry. (pause) tell her yourself!\n\n[scene, the hallway, ross, phoebe, and rachel are discussing the note.]\n\nphoebe: oh my god! chandler just left though!\n\nrachel: yeah but, maybe it’s not what we think. maybe it’s tell monica i’m sorry i…drank the last of the milk. or tell monica i'm sorry i used her tweezers to pluck my nose hairs. he does that, i've seen him.\n\nphoebe: or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he’s changed his name, y’know? tell monica i’m sorry.\n\nross: i think it means he freaked out and left!\n\nphoebe: don’t be so negative! good god! isn’t it possible that sorry is sitting in there (joey and rachel’s apartment) right now?!\n\nrachel: okay. phoebe, i-i think ross is right. what are we gonna do?\n\nross: look—okay, i’m just gonna—i’m gonna have to go find him and bring him back! okay? you-you make sure monica does not find out, okay?\n\nrachel: okay.\n\nphoebe: (pointing at ross) okay but if you don’t find him and bring him back, i am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!\n\n(ross laughs and phoebe points harder.)\n\nross: (scared) i will, i will find him.\n\n(ross leaves as the girls head back to the apartment)\n\nmonica: well the dress is done.
