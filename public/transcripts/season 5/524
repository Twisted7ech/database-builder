(heads for the bathroom.)\n\n[scene, ross and rachel's hotel room, rachel is still trying to get the ink off and ross is on the phone to the company. wait a minute, why exactly are they sharing a hotel room? didn't they like break-up or something? did i miss a memo? or maybe, it's just foreshadowing things to come. who knows? maybe the answer's at the bottom of the page. then again, maybe it isn't and it's just one of those things tv writers just don't explain. anyhoo…]\n\nross: (on the phone) yes, hello. i have a question. umm, i used your pen to draw on my friend's face.

(watching her.) that is, one big drink!\n\nrachel: (she's finished reliving the fridge of its entire alcohol content.) macadamia nut?\n\nross: (looking at the price list) umm… wow! that's-that's some pricey nut!\n\nrachel: hm-mmm! (opens the container)\n\nross: really like those macadamia nuts, huh?\n\nrachel: nope! (she puts one in her mouth and spits it out, then does it again in another direction.)\n\n[scene, the casino, phoebe is playing on a slot machine. suddenly the lurker sticks her head around the aisle of slot machines.]\n\nphoebe: (seeing her) get out of here you lurker!

(to chandler) okay, you look that way; i'll look this way!\n\nchandler: all right!\n\n(he searches to his right; she searches to her left. they're both on their hands and knees when they spot the die. it's propped up against the table leg, and it's not lying flat. both the four and the five are showing.)\n\nchandler: here it is! here it is!\n\nmonica: that could be a four or a five. it's your call.\n\n(pause.)\n\nchandler: it's a four.\n\nmonica: i think so too.\n\n(cue up the music as they move in and kiss. this time i think it's perry como, but i'm not sure. it's everybody loves somebody, sometime! everybody falls in love somehow! something in your kiss, just told me, my sometime, is now!)\n\n[scene, the slot machines, phoebe is still feeding quarters into the one-armed bandit as the lurker peeks over the top of the machines.]\n\nphoebe: oh well, lost again. (she gets up and slowly moves away. the lurker scurries in and takes her spot, only this time phoebe set a trap for her and catches her in the act.) that's it! you and me, outside!\n\nthe lurker: i don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair!\n\n(they start smacking each other's cups, but phoebe notices a security guard approaching.)\n\nphoebe: be cool! (they both pretend to have a nice conversation as the guard walks by, but after he leaves they both start fighting again.) okay lady, your lurking days are over!\n\nthe lurker: what?!\n\nphoebe: yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, i'm gonna lurk first! you move on to someone else, i'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! and then i'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til monday, because that's when i go home. when do you leave?\n\nthe lurker: also monday.\n\nphoebe: what time? maybe we can share a cab!\n\n[scene, ross and rachel's room, they've pretty much consumed the entire mini-bar. needless to say, they're feeling no pain and are still playing blackjack.]\n\nrachel: hit me.

(he starts to sit down on the bed. there's one problem though, he's about two feet to the left of it. needless to say, he misses and falls on his butt.) (looking up at joey.) whoa-oh-whoa! are you, are you okay?\n\njoey: yeah! i'm fine! thanks! (he starts to leave, but gets an idea and stops.) hey rach, how you doin'?\n\nrachel: i'm doin' good, baby. how you doin'?\n\njoey: ross, don't let her drink anymore!

"join me, and together we'll rule the universe as father and son!"
