(she just stares at him.) i've done it again.\n\njoey: she's my biggest fan. yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.\n\n(they both start speaking italian to each other, and since i'm not italian and don't understand one word, we'll move on to the english portion of the show. not, that i'm english. not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just that i'm not. y'know i think i should shut-up now and move on. anyhoo, she says something about joey being fat i think based on this line.)\n\njoey: yeah, i uh weighted like 27 pounds when i was born so…\n\nmonica: (entering from the bathroom) hey! happy anniversary!\n\nchandler: happy anniversary, 10 months! (they kiss.)\n\nmonica: so umm, when i was in the shower i was thinking about our first night in london…\n\nchandler: uhh, joey's grandmother is right there.

(goes to her room.)\n\n(phoebe then gets possessed 'cause she starts speaking in tongues. she speaks italian to joey's grandmother. she is quickly exorcised and returns to speaking in english. of course, too most people english is a strange language as well. but none of them are probably reading this and if they were they wouldn't understand it. so why am i talking about them? i have absolutely no clue. moving on…)\n\njoey: wow pheebs, you speak italian?\n\nphoebe: i guess so. (see, the brief possession didn't affect her at all, like we could really tell.)\n\nrachel: (she enters and hands phoebe the earring) here you go. thank you!\n\nphoebe: wait, rach! where's the other one?\n\nrachel: oh what, you-you want both of them?\n\nphoebe: rachel karen green, where's the other earring?!\n\nrachel: okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but i kinda lost it. i know it's in the apartment, but i definitely lost it.\n\nphoebe: well, what am i going to tell monica? she wants to wear them tonight!\n\nrachel: tell her to wear her own earrings.\n\nphoebe: these are her earrings.\n\nrachel: nooo! nooooo! you lent me monica's earrings?! i'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!\n\nphoebe: why not?\n\nrachel: because i lose her stuff!\n\n[time lapse, the gang is now watching law & order. by the way, the entire rest of the episode takes place in monica and rachel's apartment. why are they called apartments when they're all stuck together? something to think about.]\n\njoey: okay, see that blind guy right there? i'm gonna bash his head in later.\n\n(his grandmother asks him something.)\n\njoey: oh umm, my big scene is coming up. big scene coming up.\n\nchandler: if you said, "big lima bean, bubbling up." would she understand the difference?\n\nmonica: (noticing rachel crawling behind the couch) rach? what are you doing?\n\nrachel: oh boy, i just can't watch. it's too scary!\n\nmonica: it's a diaper commercial.\n\nrachel: oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!\n\n(there's a knock on the door.)\n\ncaitlin: pizza delivery!\n\nross: i'll get it! i will get that!

(to monica) i was not flirting.\n\nmonica: it's okay. i don't care. it's uh, it's fine.\n\nross: really?!\n\nchandler: really?!\n\nmonica: it's no big deal, i do it all the time.\n\nchandler: (starts to laugh, but then gets serious) so umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?\n\nmonica: sure! it doesn't mean anything! just like i know it doesn't mean anything with you!\n\nchandler: okay, but there is a big difference. you are a lot hotter than i am.\n\njoey: (walking past) true story! (goes and sits down.)\n\nmonica: chandler, this actually bothers you?\n\nchandler: yes, it does bother me! and i think it would bother a lot of people. rachel, when you were going out with ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?\n\nrachel: uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.\n\nross: and thank you, for that.\n\nrachel: but y'know, i never really had anything to worry about. ross was never very good at the flirting thing.\n\nross: what?

(they have two of the cops on the street, then they cut to where they're entering an apartment.) oh my god.\n\nmonica: what?\n\njoey: (smiling) okay, everybody just keep smiling. it'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.\n\nchandler: (smiling) well, what is it?\n\njoey: (smiling) oh, they cut me out of the show.\n\nrachel: (smiling) what?!\n\nross: (smiling) are you sure?\n\nphoebe: (smiling) maybe your scene's coming up?\n\njoey: (smiling) not likely.  'cause you see that body bag right there\n\nrachel: (smiling) yeah.\n\njoey: (smiling) i'm in it.\n\ncommercial break\n\n[scene, monica and rachel's, it's continued from before the commercial break.]\n\nphoebe: (smiling) this is terrible, what are you going to do?\n\njoey: (smiling) i don't know. this little, old lady lives for my career. when they dumped me off of days of our lives she almost died.\n\nphoebe: (not smiling) that's not good.\n\njoey: (smiling) no, smile! not that face, smile! everybody smile! (they all smile.)\n\nrachel: (smiling) joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? it's not your fault.\n\nchandler: (smiling) if we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?\n\ngrandma tribbiani: (something in italian to joey.)\n\njoey: soon, soon, i'm gonna be on soon. there i am!

(walks away over to rachel.) where is that other earring?\n\nrachel: it's not here pheebs, it's not here. ohh, i went to joey and chandler's last night! okay! (goes to the door.)\n\nphoebe: make sure you check chandler's jewelry box.\n\nrachel: wait a minute. chandler has a jewelry box?\n\nphoebe: okay, we have like ten minutes. do you want me to get into that now?!\n\n(rachel heads for joey and chandler's and phoebe heads for the kitchen to find ross.)\n\nross: (to phoebe) hey pheebs! how's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? you and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?\n\nphoebe: (she just looks at him) why are you being weird?\n\nross: do you like it?\n\nphoebe: no, that would be, "why are you being cute?"\n\nross: okay, i'm working on my flirting.\n\nphoebe: ohh! i did not get that.\n\n[cut to chandler and monica on the couch.]\n\nchandler: so uh monica, do you, do you like the law & order?\n\nmonica: yeah, it's good.\n\nchandler: see, i'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the law & order and that you flirted with every guy in the tri-state area!\n\nmonica: chandler! (joey and his grandmother shush them and wave them away, which they do.) okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.\n\nchandler: oh, i'm so glad we cleared that up. look, i'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.\n\nmonica: go on, teach me something about men and women.\n\nchandler: okay, i've already taught you so much already, but whatever. see when you flirt with a guy you think, "i'm just flirting, no big deal." but the guy is thinking, "finally! somebody who wants to sleep with me!"\n\nmonica: no way!\n\nchandler: it's true.\n\nmonica: well that's pathetic!\n\nchandler: again true.\n\nmonica: and this goes for all guys?\n\nchandler: all guys that are awake. then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.\n\njoey: (to ross in the kitchen) all right, it's another commercial; i still haven't told her!\n\nross: joey! this is like the last commercial. you've got like (checks his watch) ten minutes left!\n\njoey: i know, i know! what am i going to do?

(tries to pantomime it for her.) meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. (pause.) so, you're old and small.\n\n[time lapse, rachel is coming back from chandler and joey's.]\n\nrachel: (entering) (to phoebe) (whispering) hey!\n\nphoebe: did you find it?\n\nrachel: the earring? no. but look, i found my sunglasses under the couch! i've been looking for these since like last summer.
