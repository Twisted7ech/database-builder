(she kisses him and turns to add some sugar to her tea.)\n\nchandler: (to phoebe, behind monica's back) still terrified, i'll take care of it. no problem. (when monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away he nods that he'll do it to phoebe.)\n\nopening credits\n\n[scene, monica and rachel's, joey and ross are playing catch with a little foam globe.]\n\njoey: hey ross, is uh, is staten island really an island?\n\nross: uh-huh, that's why they call it staten island.\n\njoey: ohhh. i thought it was like long island.\n\nross: (he catches the ball and pauses, staring at joey in disbelief) also an island.\n\n(the game resumes.)\n\njoey: hey, what time is it?\n\nross: (looks at his watch) 2:17.\n\njoey: wow! you realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?\n\nross: are you serious?!\n\njoey: yeah. i realized it about a half-hour ago but i didn't want to say anything 'cause i didn't want to jinx it.\n\nross: wow! we are pretty good at this! hey! we totally forgot about lunch!\n\njoey: oh, i-i, i think that's the first time i ever missed a meal!

(she goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it, ross stares in shock.) check it out!\n\n(joey turns and looks at quite possibly one of the ugliest pets that you can possibly buy on the planet. rachel has bought herself a hairless cat. yep, a hairless cat! joey and ross start to get sick.)\n\nross: what-what is it?!\n\njoey: what the hell is that?!!\n\nrachel: it's a, it's a cat!\n\njoey: that, is not a cat! {i have to agree with joey on this one.}\n\nrachel: yes it is!\n\nross: why is it inside out?!\n\nrachel: excuse me! but this is a purebred, show-quality sphinx cat!\n\nross: how much did you pay for that?\n\nrachel: well, it was a little extravagant, but i a pretty good deal.\n\nross: yeah? how much?\n\nrachel: a thousand bucks.\n\nross: on a cat??!!!!\n\njoey: it's not a cat!\n\nrachel: all right listen ball boys! my grandmother had one of these when i was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! i mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and i would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!\n\nross: free cats do that too, y'know. {which reminds me, if i might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. if you want a leash, go to the pet shop. if you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. now back to regularly scheduled programming.}\n\njoey: it's not a cat!\n\nrachel: ugh! look you guys, i'm really excited about this! okay? i don't care what you think! i'm gonna go set up a little litter box for mrs. whiskerson.

(laughs at his joke.)\n\ngary: hey chandler, what are you doing here?\n\nchandler: gary, i'm here to report a crime.\n\ngary: yeah?\n\nchandler: it is a crime that you and i don't spend more time together.\n\ngary: (laughs, then suddenly serious) what's up?\n\nchandler: well, i heard that you thinking about asking phoebe to move in with you and i thought maybe, we should have a talk. man to uh, me.\n\ngary: sure. okay.\n\nchandler: uh, are you crazy? are you insane? if you live with phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!\n\ngary: yeah, i-i considered that. i just know it would make me happy.\n\nchandler: you mean scared.\n\ngary: no, i mean happy.\n\nchandler: scared? happy?\n\ngary: chandler, what-what are you doing?\n\nchandler: i am trying to open your eyes, my man! don't you see, if you lived with phoebe she's always gonna be there. you're gonna get home, she's there. you go to bed, she's there. you wake up and oh yes, she's there!\n\ngary: i know! i can't wait!\n\nchandler: were you're parents happy, or something?\n\ngary: listen chandler, the way i see it is that i was lucky enough to find someone that i really love. i just—i wanna be around her as much as i can.\n\nchandler: wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.\n\ngary: so you know what i'm talking about, right?\n\nchandler: yeah, i think i do! y'know what? you move in with her! you move in with her right now! maybe i should in with monica!\n\ngary: no, it's too soon for you guys.\n\nchandler: (pause) yeah, you're right about that.\n\n[scene, chandler and joey's, ross and joey are still playing catch.]\n\nross: …now when they found the remains of the mesozoic mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a paleozoic amphibian in its jaws! how did it get there?!\n\n{y'know, sometimes i think the script writers throw in a line like that to try to trip me up. but it won't work. i'll always have the last laugh! <manical_laugh.wav> okay, so maybe i'm a little deluded, it's probably just my spellchecker. but, i must admit i did get mesozoic and paleozoic on the first attempt. yay me! anyhoo…}\n\njoey: maybe this should be more of a quiet game.\n\n{oh, all right!  geez, i can't have any fun!}\n\nmonica: (entering) hey guys!\n\njoey: hi!\n\nmonica: joey, i left my watch on the counter last night.

(storms out.)\n\n(monica sneezes.)\n\nmonica: oh my god, the cat's made my eyes water! don't-don't throw it to me! my vision's been compromised!!

(turns away from him.)\n\ngary: phoebe, can i talk to you for a second?\n\nphoebe: uh-huh!\n\n(he takes her into one of those typical interrogation rooms you see on tv and in the movies. which is really appropriate here, since this is a tv show. what are the odds of that?)\n\ngary: take a seat. you okay? you feeling all right?

(points to his eyes and she does so) okay, i think somebody asked someone to move in with them. and i think someone said, "yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. does that sound at all possible to you?\n\nphoebe: yes. yes! fine! i am someone! you want me to say it? i have doubts! (pause) i'm sorry! (puts her head down.)\n\ngary: phoebe…\n\nphoebe: yeah?\n\ngary: phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. i mean it is soon. and there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and i just figure that everything i really like. and the things i don't know, i get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.\n\nphoebe: that's so sweet.\n\ngary: sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. it's fine! we don't have to move in together. i just—i want you to be happy\n\nphoebe: living with you would make me happy.\n\ngary: phoebe, you don't have to say that.\n\nphoebe: no, i really wanna live with you! i wanna move in with you!\n\ngary: are you sure?\n\nphoebe: yes. definitely! yes! let's live in an apartment that we both live in!

(starts to leave.)\n\nrachel: (makes some unintelligible sound to stop her from leaving) obviously you know how to haggle, so i'm not gonna try and take you on. okay? so $800 and i don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! blind!
