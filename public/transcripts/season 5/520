(exhales strongly through his nose and joey just glares at him.) look! what is so great about that sandwich?\n\njoey: okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.\n\nchandler: okay.\n\njoey: are you thinking about monica?\n\nchandler: yeah.\n\njoey: yeah, what's that like?\n\n[scene, ross's apartment, rachel is just entering. she takes off her coat and heads for the kitchen. as she does, she knocks something off of a bookcase next to the kitchen door with her coat and it breaks.]\n\nrachel: ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! please! please! please! please! please! please! please! please! (she picks up the 2 pieces and looks at the stand.) made in mexico! yes!! ugh, who would buy this?!

(rachel runs back into the room with the tequila.) i know this is out of the blue but uh, i'm getting married tomorrow. well, maybe i am. i keep thinking about you and i'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast. are you thinking about me? of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. okay, bye.\n\nrachel: oh. oh! (takes a slug of tequila.)\n\n[scene, the ride along.]\n\nross: so where are we going next?\n\ngary: this witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.\n\nchandler: sur-surprise him? we're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?\n\njoey: come on man! (to gary) listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?\n\ngary: it's a witness not a perp. and no one talks like that!\n\nross: yeah, no one talks like that!\n\njoey: oh what? like your mr. cop!\n\nross: hey, i'm more cop than you two!\n\nchandler: how do you figure that?\n\nross: hello! i'm in the front seat, okay? i'm gary's partner!\n\nchandler: y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. it, it sounds gay.\n\nross: umm, jealous! (he drops the cherry and it turns on.)\n\ngary: hey, do you mind? we're under cover here.\n\nross: yeah, no problem. (tries to turn it off.)\n\ngary: ross!\n\nross: sorry! sorry! oh, (he sticks it under his shirt) there! (it's just there flashing through his shirt) hey gary, who am i? phone home!\n\n(gary just glares at him.)\n\n[time lapse, ross has been demoted to the back seat with joey and chandler. he's not too happy about it.]\n\nchandler: look at officer ross riding back here with the visitors.\n\njoey: yeah, what's up with that serpico?\n\n[scene, ross's apartment, rachel is playing emily's message to monica.]\n\nemily: (on answering machine) are you thinking about me? of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. okay, bye.\n\nmonica: (does rachel's) nooo!\n\nrachel: (does monica's) i know!\n\nmonica: well thank god you were here! i mean, we have to erase that!\n\nrachel: what?! we can't do that!\n\nmonica: we have too! i mean what if ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? is that what you want? ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy emily? the emily that wouldn't let him see you?\n\nrachel: noo! oh no! no! god no! he should not get back together with her. i know that! you know that! even ross knows that! but that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!\n\nmonica: i'm his sister, okay? i love him! i don't want to see him get hurt! come on! doesn’t that give me the right to control him—help him?\n\nrachel: i don't think he's the one who needs help.\n\n(they both sit down.)\n\nmonica: no, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? i mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. (rachel slowly turns and glares at her.) (realizing what she just said.) okay, fine! but i mean, look at the position she's putting him in! what's he gonna do? ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! i mean, who would do that?! (rachel again turns and glares at her in disgust.) okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! although it did involve a lot of the same people.\n\nrachel: ugh!\n\nmonica: y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.\n\nrachel: okay, you are crazy! i'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! i mean, listen! (she hits a button on the machine.)\n\nanswering machine: your messages have been erased.\n\nrachel: noooooooo!\n\n[scene, the ride along, they're all waiting outside of the witness's house and still in the car in the same places as before.]\n\nchandler: okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? i mean nothing bad can go down!\n\ngary: no. but that reminds me, (handing back a clipboard) sign this.\n\nross: what is it?\n\ngary: oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.\n\nchandler: (deadpan) oh, hurry up. i want to sign that.\n\ngary: okay, here he comes. what is he doing? what the hell is he doing?!\n\nross: what? what? what? what is it?\n\njoey: is everything okay?\n\nchandler: what's going on?\n\ngary: okay, he sees us. now don't move. don't look at him.\n\n(they all turn and look away. suddenly a loud bang sounds out and in slow motion joey slowly throws his body over ross. gary is shocked at what he sees while chandler is obviously hurt.)\n\ngary: hey, it's okay. it was just a car backfire. (joey slowly moves off of ross.) hey, look at that! you tried to save your buddy. you see that? you see what he did?\n\njoey: (to ross) you okay man?\n\nross: uh-huh. thank joey!\n\nchandler: uh, hello!!\n\njoey: hi.\n\ncommercial break\n\n[scene, ross's apartment, monica has all the supplies she needs and is getting ready to leave.]\n\nmonica: all right, i guess we should go.\n\nrachel: no, wait. wait.\n\nmonica: oh yeah right!

(he hangs up.)\n\nmonica: wow! play that message for emily and this whole problem goes away!\n\nrachel: right?\n\n[scene, central perk, the guys are returning from the ride along to find phoebe already there.]\n\ngary: hey, anybody want to meet a hero?\n\nphoebe: (excited) john glenn is here?!\n\ngary: no, joey!\n\nross: pheebs, we had the most incredible night! okay, so, we're in the car…\n\ngary: wait! hold on!

(to phoebe) hi!\n\nphoebe: hi!\n\ngary: (to ross) okay, go ahead.\n\nross: okay, okay, so we're in the car. right? and bang! a shot was fired. and joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!\n\nphoebe: my god, joey!\n\nchandler: (pouting) it was a car backfire!\n\nross: yeah, but-but he didn't know that!\n\njoey: yeah, i didn't know that.\n\nross: and it could've just as easily have been a bullet.\n\ngary: hey joe, you ever think about joining the force? we could use a guy like you.\n\nchandler: who jumps at loud noises!\n\nross: wow! i could've died tonight.\n\nchandler: yeah! if the car that backfired had run over you! y'know what, i think i'll go home before ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. (he gets up and starts for the door.)\n\nross: i do have a newfound respect for life.\n\nchandler: (returning) oh my god! (storms out.)\n\ngary: (to phoebe) so you wanna get some dinner?\n\nphoebe: yeah! sure! yep! (gets up) oh, y'know what? if i heard a shot right now, i'd throw my body on you.\n\ngary: oh yeah? well maybe you and i should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.\n\nphoebe: okay!\n\ngary: all right.\n\nphoebe: bye!\n\nross and joey: bye!\n\n(they leave as ross stares in awe at joey.)\n\njoey: cut it out ross! i hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!\n\n[scene, chandler and joey's, chandler is pacing as joey enters.]\n\njoey: dude! how come you took off?\n\nchandler: oh, i just went for a walk, around the living room. whatever…\n\njoey: is something wrong?\n\nchandler: no. no i'm just tired. y'know, from-from the walk.\n\njoey: okay.\n\nchandler: you dove in front of ross! ross!\n\njoey: that's what this is about! oh my god, you hate ross!\n\nchandler: i do not hate ross!\n\njoey: of course you do! i saved him! you're mad at me! it all adds up! you want ross out of the picture.\n\nchandler: what picture?\n\njoey: i don't know, but i don't like what i'm hearing!\n\nchandler: look i'm very glad that you saved ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!\n\njoey: ohh, you're upset because you think i chose ross over you! no! i…knew…you could take care of yourself. y'know, i mean ross, he need help. he's not street like us!\n\nchandler: when it comes down to it, you would risk your life for ross before you would for me. that's the bottom line.\n\njoey: well, no, not exactly! all right, look, i, i wasn't trying to save ross. okay? my sandwich was next to ross. all right? i was, i was trying to save my sandwich.\n\nchandler: from a bullet!\n\njoey: i know it doesn't make much sense…\n\nchandler: much sense?!\n\njoey: look chandler, it was instinct! okay? i just went for it!\n\nchandler: so you risked your life, for a sandwich!\n\njoey: i know it sounds crazy, but chandler this is (goes and picks up the sandwich) the greatest sandwich in the world!\n\nchandler: so you didn't uh, choose ross before me.\n\njoey: no! i would never do that! you-you're like my brother!\n\nchandler: really?!\n\njoey: yeah! in fact, to prove how much you mean to me, (he unwraps the sandwich and holds it out for chandler) here.\n\nchandler: thanks. (he grabs the sandwich.)\n\njoey: no, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!\n\n(chandler takes a bite.)\n\njoey: how good is that?\n\nchandler: (with his mouthful) oh-oi-ho, yeah!\n\njoey: see?\n\nchandler: hm-hmm. (goes to take another bite.)\n\njoey: oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!\n\nchandler: i thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.\n\njoey: yeah. with a bite! (takes back the sandwich.) gee-e-e-eez!\n\n[scene, ross's apartment, rachel is trying to repair the thing she broke earlier, but gets interrupted by hearing ross at the door. she panics and throws the thing into the kitchen. and runs to the couch as ross enters.]\n\nrachel: hey! hi!\n\nross: rach, what uh, what are you doing here?\n\nrachel: hey! y'know what? you are in our apartment all the time! okay? this is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!\n\nross: y'know, it-it doesn't matter. the important thing is that you're here. you're my friend, and you're here. oh! (he goes over and hugs her.)\n\nrachel: okay, just a little scared. what's going on ross?\n\nross: the most amazing thing happened tonight. i thought my number was up. i had an actual near death experience!\n\nrachel: what?! what? what happened?!\n\nross: okay, okay, we were on the ride along with gary, right?\n\nrachel: yeah!\n\nross: and somebody took a shot at me!\n\nrachel: (gasps) really?!\n\nross: no, a car backfired, but (rachel suddenly calms down) i thought somebody was taking a shot at me. and rach, i…i survived! and i was filled with this-this great respect for life. y'know? i-i want to experience every moment. i want to seize every opportunity. i-i am seeing everything so-so clearly now.\n\nrachel: because a car backfired?\n\nross: (stares at her briefly) okay, why are you here?\n\nrachel: well, i-i-i don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, emily called you today.\n\nross: you talked to her?\n\nrachel: no, she left a message. (he starts for the machine.) (stopping him.) but it-it kinda got erased. there's just (pause) something wrong with your machine.\n\nross: well, okay, what-what did she say?\n\nrachel: well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.\n\nross: wow!\n\nrachel: now, that-that was a good thing that i told you, right?\n\nross: huh? yeah! yes, of course!\n\nrachel: okay. thank you! thank you! because—i'm sorry, all right. because y'know what? she didn't want me—not important. the point is, i was right. your decision. okay? i was right. (she starts for the door.) (stops) your decision.\n\nross: right. i guess, i guess i should call emily.\n\nrachel: okay, no, that's not the right decision. that's not, that's not right, no ross-ross, come on! i mean, that woman made you miserable! okay, ross, do you really want to get back into that?\n\nross: okay, look, yesterday i would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day i have a near death experience. i mean, that-that has got to mean something!\n\nrachel: ugh, ross! that was not a near death experience! that was barely an experience!\n\nross: you weren't there! okay, maybe this is something that i-i'm supposed to seize! y'know?\n\nrachel: okay, y'know what? maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. maybe this is about escaping stuff.\n\nross: huh.\n\nrachel: i mean, look-look today you escaped (pause) (not believing it) death, y'know? and maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily?\n\nross: that does make sense. because i do wanna seize some opportunity, but i-i really don't wanna see or talk to her.\n\nrachel: well, there you go!\n\nross: yeah. maybe today is just, close call day.\n\nrachel: (laughing) close call day.\n\nross: hey, thanks rach. (they hug.)\n\nrachel: ohh, honey no problem. okay. (gets up.)\n\nross: oh wait-wait-wait! the message is blinking. maybe you didn't erase it.\n\nrachel: oh?\n\n(ross hits the playback button.)\n\nross: (on machine) "hey ross, it's you!" (hits the stop button) oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.\n\nrachel: no.

(points at ross who points back.)\n\nphoebe: well you all know that i'm a pacifist so i'm not interested in war in any way.
