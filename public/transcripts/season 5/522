(holds up 3 of them in different colors.)\n\n(monica stares at him.)\n\nchandler: what?\n\nmonica: i love you.\n\n{there's another continuity error here. before monica says i love you, chandler's holding the vests so that you couldn't see the collar, you could see all three, and they were folding nicely. after she says the line and the camera cuts back to chandler, you can only see two out of the three, you can see the collar of the top one, and it looks like it was folded sloppily, unlike before. hey, you notice things while spending this much time on this!}\n\njoey: man, i wish ross was coming with us! y'know? i'm gonna miss him!\n\nphoebe: thanks a lot! i just got that jerk out of my mind!\n\nchandler: hey, so where are we staying? is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?\n\njoey: uh no, not really. it's an independent film y'know? so we don't have a real big budget. i figured i'd just stay in your room.\n\nchandler: i see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? i mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?\n\njoey: oh yeah! for every dollar shutter speed makes, one penny of it goes right in joey's pocket.\n\nchandler: so you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?\n\njoey: did you not hear the plot of the movie? "she's been dead for ten years." i'm gonna be a millionaire!\n\nross: (entering) hey!\n\njoey: hey!\n\nross: i just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? twenty bucks on black 15.\n\njoey: you got it!\n\nross: all right!\n\n(joey nods to chandler, no way!)\n\nchandler: all right, bye-bye now!\n\nphoebe: bye!\n\nrachel: bye you guys!\n\njoey: bye-bye!\n\nmonica: i wanna say good-bye at the car!\n\nchandler: okay!\n\njoey: anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?\n\nrachel: oh honey, i'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.\n\n(pause.)\n\njoey: see ya!
